COLD OPEN:
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
On TV, a BACHELOR holds a rose. Dramatic music plays.
BACHELOR 1
Cynthia...
BETH, JERRY, SUMMER, MORTY and RICK are watching TV.
JERRY 2
Oh my God, no. No.
SUMMER 3
I told you!
BETH 4
Hold on...
BACHELOR 5
Will you please NOT marry me, I
choose Veronica.
The music swells.
SUMMER 6
(speaking over each other)
What?!
JERRY 7
Yes!
BETH 8
Called it.
SUMMER 9
Why would he choose Veronica?!
JERRY 10
Because he loves her.
RICK 11
Well, if it’s any consolation,
Summer, none of it mattered and the
entire show was stupid.
JERRY 12
Okay - I’ve got an idea, Rick.
(hands him remote)
You show us your concept of good TV
and we’ll crap all over that.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 1.
RICK 13
Thought you’d never ask.
Rick goes to the DVR and quickly dismantles it.
JERRY 14
Hey!
Rick pulls several pieces of exotic equipment from his
pockets, including a tiny, shimmering crystal, which he
solders into the DVR’s circuitry.
MORTY 15
Oh, cool, is that crystallized
xanthanite?
(to Jerry)
It conducts electrons across
dimensions.
RICK 16
Twenty percent accurate as usual,
Morty. The important thing being, I
just upgraded our cable package
with programming from every
conceivable reality.
Rick sits and starts flipping with the remote.
JERRY 17
Wait, does that mean we get
Showtime Extreme?
RICK 18
How about Showtime Extreme in a
world where man evolved from corn?
On TV:
A man made of corn wearing a SUIT holds a gun on a man made
of corn wearing a dirty WIFE BEATER t-shirt.
SUIT 19
We’re not so different. We’re both
corn of action.
WIFE BEATER 20
Yeah but one of us is dead corn -
The man in the wife beater quick-draws a gun taped to his
back and shoots the man in the suit. Kernels fly everywhere.
SUMMER 21
Boring.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 2.
RICK 22
Summer, (BURP) you just spent
(BURP) three months watching a man
choose a fake wife.
JERRY 23
So, what, it’d be better if the
people were corn?
RICK 24
Jerry, you don’t get it.
Rick flips rapidly through weird channels.
RICK (CONT’D) 25
This is infinite TV from infinite
universes. Look.
On TV: a man eats shit.
MAN 26
This shit is delicious.
RICK 27
A movie about a guy eating shit.
Rick flips. We see an antiques appraiser punch a woman.
RICK (CONT’D) 28
A violent antiques show.
Rick flips again.
On TV: Jerry is talking to David Letterman.
DAVID LETTERMAN 29
It’s a pleasure to have you.
JERRY 30
The pleasure’s all mine.
RICK 31
Letterman from a timeline where
Jerry’s famous.
Rick flips channels.
On TV: a teddy bear spins a web. The entire family reacts to
what they saw on the previous channel.
JERRY 31B
Wait!
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 3.
SUMMER 31C
What?
BETH 32
What in the hell?!
RICK 33
I agree, where is this going?
JERRY 34
No! The other thing! Go back!
RICK 35
Really? Alright, fine.
On the TV, the man continues eating shit. A WOMAN enters and
hands him a piece of paper.
WOMAN 36
Glen, this is a court order. It
says you can’t eat shit anymore.
Music sting.
RICK 37
Alright, Jerry, when you’re right,
you’re right. Now I’m hooked.

Coming up next on “Shmloo’s the
Shmloss”; Shmlony has a nightmare!
Alternate Tony Danza is screaming in his sleep.
SHLMONY 39
Shmlantha! Shmlona!
RICK 40
Amazing. A dimension where all
proper nouns begin with “Shml.”
On TV, Shmlony wakes up, relieved.
SHLMONY 41
Shmla Sh-shmlangela? Shmlonathan?
RICK 42
Alright, that got, that-that
actually got old pretty quick.
Rick resumes flipping channels. Jerry is frustrated beyond
belief.
JERRY 43
Rick, will you please go back to me
on David Letterman?!
RICK 44
Infinity’s a big number, Jerry. I-I
don’t remember the channel.
Jerry’s face flashes by.
BETH 45
Ah! Go back, go back!
45A Rick sighs and surfs back a channel. Jerry is a post
apocalyptic savage with a prosthetic nose.
JERRY (ON TV) 46
You speak da Tru Tru.
SUMMER 47
Oh my god. Dad’s in Cloud Atlas!
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 5.

Atlas?
JERRY (ON TV) (CONT’D) 49
Sometime small Tru Tru diff’rent

BETH 50
How is this possible?!
RICK 51
Infinite timelines, infinite
possibilities, including a timeline
where Jerry’s a movie star. Look,

the wrong aspect of this device. Du

EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
A KILLER talks to no one in particular.
KILLER S10
I’m the killer!
He puts his gun to his mouth and the camera pans right to
reveal the Quick Mystery Host. We hear the gunshot and blood
splatters on the host.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
RICK 52
Now who wants to watch random,
crazy TV shows from different
dimensions and-and-and-and then who
wants to narcissistically obsess
about their alternate selves?
JERRY / BETH / SUMMER 53
I want to obsess about myself /
narcissistically obsess / the
narcissistic option
53A Rick sighs. He digs a pair of goggles out of his pocket.
RICK 54
Here. These scan your retinas and
let you view parallel timelines
through genetically matching
versions of your eyes. Go fetch.
Rick tosses the goggles toward the kitchen. Jerry, Beth and
Summer scramble after them.
SUMMER / BETH 54A
This is so cool! / Yes! Ladies
first!
RICK 55
I’m proud of you, Morty.
MORTY 56
Hey, man, I don’t give a crap about
myself, Rick. Let’s watch some
crazy stuff, yo.
INT. ON TV - SKETCH - ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 8.
INT. APPLIANCE STORE COMMERCIAL - DAY
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON, a man in a cheap suit with ants
swarming all over his eyes stands in an appliance store like
one of those “Crazy Eddie” appliance commercials.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON S11
I’m Ants In My Eyes Johnson here at
Ants In My Eyes Johnsons
Electronics! I mean there’s so many
ants in my eyes and there’s so many
TV’s! Microwaves! Radios!
Johnson stumbles along a sparsely filled shelf, pointing to
incorrect products as he calls out what he thinks he’s
pointing at. Cheesy bold text advertising “TV’s! MICROWAVES!
RADIOS!” appears on screen as he calls those items out. (but
text not too big that we obscure the joke that he’s pointing
at the wrong items)
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (CONT’D) S12
I think! I can’t,
(he stops and faces what
he think is the direction
of the camera, but he’s
slightly off)
I’m not 100% sure what we have here
in stock because I can’t see
anything!
We cut to a tight shot of Johnson’s eyes here.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (CONT’D) S13
Our prices, I hope, aren’t too low!
Johnson stops and gestures to a dishwasher.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (CONT’D) S14
Check out this refrigerator! Only
two hundred dollars!
The price tag of the dishwasher says $5. Johnson then stands
in front of a microwave that’s labeled as “FREE.” takes two
steps over, we pan with, and he points to a lit stove. His
sleeve catches fire, but he doesn’t notice or react.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (CONT’D) S15
What about this microwave? Only a
hundred dollars! That’s fair!
We see a customer steal something in the background. Another
customer is playing with a stove and turns on all four of the
burners. She walks off camera as Johnson is walking up.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 9.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (CONT’D)
I’m Ants in my eyes Johnson!
Everything’s black! I can’t see a
thing, and also I can’t feel
anything either,
(he holds out his arms and his
sleeve catches on fire)
did I mention that? But that’s not
as catchy as having ants in your
eyes so that always goes, you know,
off by the wayside. I can’t feel,
it’s a very rare disease, all my
sense-- all my nerves, they don’t
allow for the sensation of touch.
Throughout the speech, the flamees spread over Johnson entire
body as people continue stealing items from the store.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Angle on Rick and Morty watching. We just watch them as they
stare ahead. We hear Ants in my Eyes Johnson go on.
ANTS IN MY EYES JOHNSON (O.S.) S16
So I never know what’s going on, am
I standing, sitting? I don’t know.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
Beth holds the goggles.
BETH 59
Are we sure we want to do this?
Look at our own alternate lives?
JERRY 60
You’re right, maybe we should just
play Yahtzee, GIVE ME THOSE.
Jerry snatches the goggles and puts them on.
BETH 61
What do you see?
JERRY 62
Whiteness. Pure whiteness.
POV ALTERNATE JERRY - WHITE SCREEN
We hear a snort and the POV moves up, revealing:
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 10.
INT. HOLLYWOOD NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS
Johnny Depp, holding a metal straw, stares at us from across
a glass table covered with a pile of cocaine.
JOHNNY 63
You’re my best friend, Jerry Smith.
I love doing cocaine with you.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry reaches out in front of him.
JERRY 64
Whoa! I love doing cocaine with you
too, Johnny Depp!
BETH 65
(taking goggles)
Ugh! Haven’t we spent enough time
on you?
Beth puts on the goggles.
POV ALTERNATE BETH:
INT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS
We see a body opened up.
BETH 66
I’m performing surgery...
Her POV looks to the left to reveal a man passed out.
BETH (V.O.) 67
But not on a horse, on a human!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry pats Beth on the shoulder.
JERRY 68
That’s great, Beth. You always
wanted to be a real surgeon.
Beth removes the goggles to look at Jerry.
BETH 69
I am a real surgeon.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 11.
JERRY 70
(at a loss)
Gahhhhhhhhhhh, Summer’s turn!
Beth looks at the floor while Summer snatches the goggles
from Jerry and holds them to her eyes.
SUMMER 71
Finally. I don’t see anything.
BETH 72
Well, you should select a different
timeline, I mean, if your father
and I achieved our dreams, there’s
a chance you weren’t even born,
that came out wrong, that came out
very wrong.
SUMMER 73
Fine, I’ll find a world where you
bothered to have me.
She toggles the switch on the side of the goggles a few
times. She looks through the goggles for a moment, then looks
sad.
SUMMER (CONT’D) 74
We’re playing Yahtzee.
BETH 75
(at a loss)
Yahtzee’s fun.
(to Jerry)
We love Yahtzee.
JERRY 76
It’s a fun game for fun families,
hey, could I... get those goggles
back for a second?
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

INT. ON TV - SKETCH - MR. SNEEZY CAR AD
EXT. WINDING ROAD - FALL - DAY
A colorful, weird, strange, clown type car hugs a curvy hill
side road in a beautiful European type country.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 12.
CAR COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER 76A
It’s a 45 horsepower with anti-lock
breaks, and it’s the official car
of Mr. Sneezy 3-D.
The car drives off road, it goes over some boulders no
problem. We see it race down a straight road in a beautiful
European meadow with large beautiful mountains in the
background. The car drives off a cliff into the water below
and a propellor pops out from the rear bumper to propel it
through the water. The car comes spinning down a road then
stops on a dime, driving into the perfect framing for it.
CAR COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER (CONT’D) 76B
It’s the brand new Sneezy XL. The
horn when you honk it makes a
sneeze noise. (HONK/SNEEZE) It’s
polite, it’s right, and it’s
Sneezy, deezy Mc...Deluxe.
The car door opens, revealing Mr. Sneezy coming out. Think
Mr. Bean but more colorful clothes and tiny and skinny,
strange just like the car itself.
MR. SNEEZY 76C
Aw, I’m Mr. Sneezy. Atchoo.

TWO BROTHERS VOICEOVER S23
With weapons made from to-tomatoes.
And you better bet your bottom

Mexican Armada Brothers Who Are
Just Regular Brothers Running In A
Van From An Asteroid And All Sorts
Of Things” The Movie.
This long title fills the screen.
TWO BROTHERS VOICEOVER (CONT’D) S25
Hold on, there’s more.
The brothers are fighting back to back. They turn to see a
ton of tough old women show up like gangs in The Warriors. We
kung fu movie zoom into the old women. They attack. The
Mexican Armada fires their weapons at the two brothers. One
of the brothers uses a giant cat monster as a shield then
throws it at a sombrero spaceship. A fight ensues.
TWO BROTHERS VOICEOVER (CONT’D) S26
Old women are coming, and they’re
also in the movie, and they’re
gonna come and cross attack these

Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel
Prize!

Come on, time’s up.
Jerry grabs the goggles from Beth. He holds them to his eyes.
JERRY (CONT’D) 81
I’m taming a lion. No, wait, uh
there are film cameras, I might be
a lion tamer in a movie.
(hands Summer goggles)
You get the idea, I work with
lions.
Summer looks through the goggles.
SUMMER 82
(mock surprise)
Oo, we’re not playing Yahtzee!
We’re playing Chutes and Ladders.
(puts goggles down)
Seems like when I exist, life gets
a little more... I don’t know,
predictable?
BETH 83
When two people create a life
together, they set aside their
previous lives as individuals.
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 16.
JERRY 84
Give me a break, we’re not heroes
for having unprotected sex on prom
night.
BETH 85
Oh, I get it, now that you know you
could’ve had it better, you resent
me for holding you back.
JERRY 86
Well now that we know you think the
tables are turning, we know you
thought there were unturned tables.
BETH 87
What are you talking about?
JERRY 88
All this time, you’ve been
thinking, “What if that loser Jerry
hadn’t talked me out of the
abortion?”
SUMMER 89
Um.
JERRY 90
Well now you know. You’d be a
doctor. Whoopdee doo. You’d also be
drinking wine alone in a house full
of exotic birds and I’d be on
DiCaprio’s yacht-
(brandishes goggles)
-banging Kristin Stewart!
SUMMER 91
You thought about getting an
abortion?
BETH 92
Everyone thinks about it.
Obviously, I’m the version of me
that didn’t do it, so, you’re
welcome.
JERRY 93
Yeah, you’re welcome.
SUMMER 94
Yeah, thank you guys so much! It’s
a real treat to be raised by
parents that force themselves to be
together instead of being happy!
RAM 108 "INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (8/5/13) 17.
Beth and Jerry look at each other, unsure of what to say.
There’s a long silence.
Rick enters in a hurry and starts looking through cabinets.
RICK 95
Hey, do we have any wafer cookies?
(finds them)
Mmm. Oo boy, you guys look like
you’ve been looking at alternate
lives and realizing you don’t have
it as good, huh. That’s too bad.
You know, me and Morty are having a
blast, we -
RICK (CONT’D) 96
just discovered a show called Ball
Fondlers, I mean, I don’t want to

Summer alternates between looking at Jerry and Beth, who each
alternate between looking at each other and the floor.
BETH 99
So now what do we do?
JERRY 100
That show Ball Fondlers sounded
kind of interestingSUMMER 101
Dad!
JERRY 102
What?! They’re having fun in there.
What do you guys want from me?
Every family on this block has to
wonder if they’re together by
choice. Our family just has
interdimensional goggles to show us
for a fact that we’re not.

Well how does that work? I mean, do

Grandpa Rick, if they leave the
butt and the person wanders off,

hear the TV! Alright, that’s it.
