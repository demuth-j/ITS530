COLD OPEN:
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
Beth and Summer stand near the car. Jerry, dressed like a
turn-of-the-century peasant, closes the trunk. Rick, Morty,
and Summer stand together in the driveway.
SUMMER
(simultaneously)
Bye, Mom! Bye, Dad!
MORTY
(simultaneously)
Drive carefully!
RICK
Have fun, you two.
BETH
Yes, we will have as much fun as
possible on our...
(sigh)
Titanic-themed getaway.
JERRY
Let’s lose the ‘tude, please, it’s
supposed to be romantic.
SUMMER
Didn’t like, five thousand people
die on the Titanic?
JERRY
The getaway is based on the movie,
not the disaster.
BETH
Speaking of disasters, Dad, we are
leaving you in charge, here.
RICK
I know, can we wrap this up? Morty
and I have synthetic laser eels
oxidizing in the garage.
BETH
Hey, don’t blow me off, I’m drawing
a line. Any damage to this house or
these children when we get back,
and... no more adventures with
Morty.

MORTY
(to Rick)
Holy crap, if Mom’s saying it, it
must be serious this time.
BETH
(simultaneously)
That’s right.
JERRY
(simultaneously)
That’s right - wait, what?
RICK
Listen, you have my word as a
caregiver, everything will be fine.
And if not, like you say, no more
adventures or whatever.
Beth and Jerry get into the car.
JERRY
Not one thing out of place.
They back out of the driveway, pull into the road, and stop.
JERRY
Not a single thing.
The car takes off around the corner.
A beat, and then a school of synthetic laser eels eat through
the garage door and swim away into the atmosphere.
SUMMER
(observing)
Well, we’re past the point of no
return, I’m going to have a party.
END COLD OPEN

ACT ONE
INT. MORTY’S HOME - KITCHEN - LATER
Summer is standing in front of an open cupboard and talking
on her phone.
SUMMER
I found jello, can you sneak your
mom’s vodka?
(pause)
Yes, she does, I saw it in your
laundry room.
(pause)
Listen, you can’t both be in denial
about it. Okay, this party is going
to be epic, see you soon.
She hangs up. Morty enters.
MORTY
Summer, you can’t throw a party!
Remember what Mom said?
SUMMER
Yeah, if anything gets messed up,
you and Grandpa Rick get punished.
I’m only a human being, Morty.
Rick enters.
MORTY
Tell Summer she can’t have a party!
RICK
Summer, you can’t have a party.
She scoffs.
RICK
Because I’m having a party.
MORTY
What?! Rick, you can’t!
SUMMER
What do you mean you’re having a
party? Are some glip glops from the
third dimension going to come over
and play cards or something?
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 3.
RICK
“Glip glop?!” Man, you’re lucky a
Trakflorian doesn’t hear you say
that.
SUMMER
Why, is that like their N-Word?
RICK
It’s like the N word and the C word
had a baby and it was raised by all
the bad words for Jews.
MORTY
I think the three of us could just
have a nice time bonding and
getting to know each other.
SUMMER
Screw that. It’s party time. This
is my chance to gain some footing
with the cool kids.
RICK
That’s why you party? Boy you
really are seventeen.
SUMMER
Why do you party?
RICK
To get-
(shaking face)
Wriggedy wriggedy WRECKED, son!
SUMMER
Just keep your sci-fi friends away
from my awesome ones.
RICK
Yeah, and you keep your awesome
friends away from my canapes.
Reveal: Rick delicately making a plate of hors d’oevres.
INT. TITANIC 2 - DECK - DAY
Beth and Jerry are being shown around by a TOUR GUIDE.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 4.
GUIDE
The Titanic 2 is the most state-ofthe art Titanic replica ever
designed of the three, not
including the one spelled with a TO-O. They use bio-diesel.
FEMALE PATRON #1
Is this where the lifeboats should
have been?
GUIDE
Exactly correct. You miss nothing,
do you?
The crowd gasps.
JERRY
(whispering)
That’s from the movie! This guy is
a pro.
GUIDE
After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach
to the rail system near our replica
iceberg, and the hydraulics encased
in these tubesHe knocks on a tubular column.
GUIDE
-will execute a controlled sink
into the icy depths.
(aside)
Icy and depths are simulated, of
course.
JERRY
Excuse me, sir. A rail system seems
archaic for an attraction this
impressive, are you sure that the
ship will sink?
GUIDE
I can assure you the ship will sink
as it has a thousand times before.
It’s UN-unsinkable.
The group claps politely.
JERRY
(whispers)
Pro.

EXT. TITANIC 2 - DECK - LATER
Jerry spots a line of people at the bow.
JERRY
Look, it’s the line for the bow!
BETH
Jerry, work has been really
stressful lately. I’d love to just
kick back with a margarita and
read. Do you mind if I skip the
“King of the World” bit?
JERRY
Well, ugh, it’s not the “King of
the World bit”, that’s Jack and
Fabrizio. This is where Rose says
“I’m flying, Jack”, but whatever, I
can be the only one to do it alone.
Beth looks around in frustration and spots LUCY, a fullfigured cleaning lady watching the attraction fondly.
BETH
What about her?
(to Lucy)
Excuse me, ma’am. Would you like to
take my place in line?
Lucy cautiously approaches.
LUCY
I... I could get in trouble.
BETH
We won’t tell.
Beth removes her hat and places it on Lucy’s head. She steps
out of line and inserts Lucy next to Jerry.
JERRY
Come on, Beth, this is weird.
BETH
Weirder than a grown man standing
on the bow of a fake Titanic by
himself?
JERRY
Can’t argue there. Catch up with
you later.
Beth walks away and pulls out a giant book about horses.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 6.
BETH
Boom goes the dynamite.
JERRY
(to Lucy)
So... you’re a Titanic fanatic?
LUCY
Oh yes. I’ve worked here since it
opened but I’ve never been able to
participate.
JERRY
Happy to help, Rose.
He links arms with her. She giggles.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING
A handful of kids sit around drinking out of red plastic
cups. The doorbell rings. Summer opens the door to reveal
BRAD and his crew.
SUMMER
Brad! Hey!
BRAD
(blows past her)
Yo.
Summer’s slutty friend TAMMY perks up.
TAMMY
Brad is here! Quick, make my hair
look drunk.
Her SLUTTY FRIENDS muss her hair. Brad passes with his
entourage.
BRAD
Check it out. Tammy’s already
drunk. Cool.
Summer tries to close the door, but it’s stopped. She looks
up to see BIRDPERSON, a statuesque hawk-man.
BIRDPERSON
The beacon was activated, who is in
danger?
SUMMER
(annoyed)
Grandpa!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 7.
Rick walks up.
RICK
Birdperson!
They exchange a ceremonial arm flapping greeting.
RICK
Everything’s cool, BP. I’m just
having a party.
BIRDPERSON
I am pleased there is no emergency.
RICK
Oh there’s an emergency alright. A
pussy emergency. When was the last
time you got laid, ‘Pers?
BIRDPERSON
It has been a... challenging mating
season for Birdperson.
RICK
Then it’s time to get your beak wet
tonight, playa. Go have some fun.
Rick waves him into the party.
MORTY
How many people did you invite,
Rick?
RICK
People?
(thinks)
Six.
MORTY
Oh, okay. That’s not so bad.
Bright light blasts through the windows. The whole house
shakes as a SPACE SHIP touches down in the front yard. A
SHITLOAD OF ALIENS pour out. Rick opens the door to greet
them.
RICK
What up, my glip glops!
Morty fumes.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 8.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SOON
Morty runs around the party cleaning up messes as they’re
created; picking up cigarette butts, empty bottles, etc.
ANGLE ON: A group of KIDS are watching TV. An ALIEN CREATURE
on screen crawls towards camera, then out of the TV ala “The
Ring.”
ALIEN CREATURE
Aw yeah, you got a party going on
in here?
A DRUNK GUY stumbles up.
DRUNK GUY
What are you guys watching?
TEENAGERS
(simultaneously)
Get out of the way!
ALIEN CREATURE
(simultaneously)
Get out of the way!
DRUNK GUY
You guys suck.
He stumbles away and trips the cord, causing the TV to turn
off, trapping the alien halfway in/halfway out of the screen.
As it struggles to free itself out, it pulls the whole TV
down, smashing it on the floor.
MORTY
Oh man!!
ALIEN CREATURE
Hey. Sorry, bro. That was just a
party trick gone bad. Normally, I
go inside a TV set when no one’s
looking, and crawl out once a
decent crowd has gathered. It’s a
real big hit usually.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - JERRY & BETH’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
TWO TEENAGERS grind away under the covers. Morty busts in.
MORTY
Not in my parent’s bed!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 9.
It’s revealed that the two teenagers are actually protrusions
on a larger ALIEN CREATURE’S back.
ALIEN CREATURE
Oh. Sorry. I’m not feeling too
well. I just needed to lie down for
a bit.
MORTY
Oh. Okay.
The creature barfs acidic slime all over the bed. The bed
dissolves.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Two CYBER WARRIORS battle in the living room.
CYBER WARRIOR #1
Tammy is mine!
CYBER WARRIOR #2
I called dibs!
They battle through the living room, destroying the place.
MORTY
Stop! She’s not that hot!
ANGLE ON: Rick chats with GEARHEAD, a muscle bound cyborg
with gears for a mouth and a translucent body that shows more
gears.
GEARHEAD
The thing people don’t realize
about the Gear Wars is that it was
never really about the gears at
all.
Rick feigns enthusiasm.
RICK
Yeah. No. Totally.
Morty comes up.
MORTY
Rick! You gotta stRICK
Morty! Have you met Gearhead?
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 10.
MORTY
(to Gearhead)
Hey.
RICK
Morty would love to hear all about
the Gear Wars.
Rick takes off. Gearhead looks down at Morty.
GEARHEAD
How familiar are you with the Gear
Wars exactly?
MORTY
Um, not at all.
GEARHEAD
(rubs his hands, excited)
Oh boy. I envy you. Okay, here goesEXT. MORTY’S HOME - LATER
The party is bumping. We see a flying saucer land. Two
creatures climb out and enter the party followed by a few
high school students walking in from the street.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Rick’s talking to an ALIEN. Morty runs up to him.
RICK
Hey, Morty, have you met Scorpius?
MORTY
Not again, Rick. That guy droned on
for twenty minutes and meanwhile,
the house is being destroyed!
RICK
(re: Scorpius)
This guy’s entire planet was
destroyed. Have some perspective.
SQUANCHY, a manic cat-like creature saunters up.
SQUANCHY
Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro! Is
there a good place for me to
squanch around here?
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 11.
RICK
Come on, Squanchy, you know any
place is a good place for you to
squanch.
SQUANCHY
Alright! I like your squanch!
Squanchy scurries off.
MORTY
Okay, Rick, what exactly is
“squanching?”
RICK
Don’t worry about it, Morty. You
wouldn’t understand.
MORTY
Is it going to result in another
mess for me to clean up?
RICK
Morty, we’ve had a lot of cool
adventures the last few months, but
it’s time to relax.
MORTY
If I relax, there might not be any
more adventures.
RICK
Jesus, Morty, you’re bumming me
out. Can’t we just pretend like
everything is fine for a few hours,
enjoy ourselves, and then worry
about it later?
MORTY
That’s easy for you to say, you
like not caring about stuff, what’s
in this for me?
Just then, JESSICA enters the party and walks right into
Morty’s eyeline. Everything slows down. “Dreamweaver” or
something less hacky plays. Jessica whips her hair back.
MORTY
(slow mo voice)
Jessica...
We pan over to Rick, also in slow motion, who looks off
camera.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 12.
RICK
(slow mo)
Knock it off, Lord Chronos!
ANGLE ON: LORD CHRONOS, a Ming the Merciless looking dude
using his mastery over time to slow down it down. He’s
obviously very drunk. He stops and everything snaps back into
normal speed.
LORD CHRONOS
(sloppy drunk)
Hahaha Sorry!
(explaining to a friend)
I have the power to manipulate timeRICK
(irritated)
Yeah, like there’s anyone left that
hasn’t heard.
MORTY
(re: Jessica)
I can’t believe she’s here.
RICK
Well what are you doing standing
here, Morty? Go talk to her.
Rick shoves Morty in Jessica’s direction.
RICK
Have some fun. Tonight, the only
adventure you’re on is your cusping
manhood.
Rick swigs his drink and walks off. Morty approaches Jessica.
MORTY
Hey, Jessica!
Lord Chronos drunkenly stumbles over behind Jessica and leans
against the wall.
JESSICA
Hey, Morty. Cool party! So this is
where you live, huh?
Jessica turn to look around right as Lord Chronos begins
puking.
JESSICA
Oh my god, that guy just puked on
the wall!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 13.
Lord Chronos drunkenly tries to kick his puke under a door.
MORTY
You know what, Jessica? Don’t even
worry about it. Someone’ll deal
with it later. Lets go have some
fun!
Morty leads Jessica off into the party.
INT. TITANIC 2 - DECK - EVENING
Jerry and Lucy run through the ship, laughing. Jerry steals a
cigarette from an unsuspecting person’s mouth.
EXT. TITANIC 2 - DECK RAILING - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Lucy stop at the deck railing. Employees are
stocking floating door rafts.
JERRY
Is that what I think it is?
LUCY
Yes, every couple gets to recreate
Jack’s drowning at the end of the
movie. It’s so romantic.
JERRY
I can’t wait to do that with Beth.
LUCY
Please, anyone can see that when it
comes to movies released in 1997,
Beth is a Fifth Elementer all the
way.
JERRY
Is that what they call fans of “The
Fifth Element?”
LUCY
Of course! Can’t you see she’s
doing everything in her power to
push us closer together?
They exchange a gaze before Jerry’s attention is diverted.
JERRY
Look!
ANGLE ON: The iceberg is approaching.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 14.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is
now closed. Iceberg, right ahead!
The buffet is now closed...
Couples pour to the railing. Jerry looks for Beth to no
avail. He turns back to see that the ship is moving away from
the iceberg.
INT. TITANIC 2 - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
A CREWMAN is consulting some instruments.
CREWMAN
Uh, sir? There’s not a problem.
CAPTAIN
What do you mean, there’s not a
problem?
CREWMAN
The guidance system isn’t putting
us on a direct collision course.
Sir.
(dramatic)
This ship is about to completely
miss that giant iceberg.
CAPTAIN
Well, DO SOMETHING! Steer into it!
CREWMAN
I’m TRYING!
He’s trying desperately to steer the ship.
CAPTAIN
It’s too late.
(gets on P.A.)
Ladies and gentlemen... don’t brace
yourselves.
Different departments scramble to turn the ship. Sailors run
back and forth from bow to stern. The crewman’s eyes widen.
EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS
An overhead shot of the ship as it slowly floats past the
iceberg.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 15.
INT. TITANIC 2 - NIGHT
The crowd gasps.
JERRY
No! What happened?
LUCY
The rail system must have failed.
People stand on the deck, bewildered.
PAYING CUSTOMER #1
Does this mean we’re not going to
sink?
PAYING CUSTOMER #2
Dear God.
Panicked murmurs break out.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Tammy is flirting with Birdperson on the couch.
TAMMY
I like your feathers.
BIRDPERSON
They are designed to attract the
attention of the female.
TAMMY
It’s working.
BIRDPERSON
Tammy, I should let you know, I
just got out of a pretty intense
soul bond with my previous spirit
mate.
TAMMY
I’m not looking to get into a soul
bond. I’m just looking for...
She whispers something in his ear.
BIRDPERSON
I believe Birdperson can arrange
that.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 16.
INT. MORTY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Summer and her friends are hanging out. NANCY, a nerdy girl
walks over to Summer.
NANCY
Hey, Summer. Haven’t seen you at
flute practice in awhile.
SUMMER’S FRIEND #2
Summer, are you friends with her?
SUMMER
Pfth. No. I don’t even know what
she’s doing here.
RICK
Not cool, Summer. It’s a party,
everyone should be welcome.
The kitchen wall explodes. Everyone backs away as a menacing
figure steps through a cloud of smoke into the kitchen. This
is ABRODOLPH LINCOLER, a large, intimidating man that looks
like a cross between Lincoln and Hitler.
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
Where... is... Rick Sanchez?!
RICK
Oh no... I can’t believe he showed
up.
SUMMER
What’s the matter, Rick? I thought
everyone was welcome.
RICK
It’s not the same, Summer.
Abrodolph Lincoler is a crazed
maniac. A misguided effort of mine
to create a morally neutral super
leader by combining the DNA of
Adolph Hitler and Abraham Lincoln.
Turns out it adds up to a lame wack
job.
Lincoler spots Rick.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 17.
LINCOLER
Rick... You brought me into this
world, a suffering abomination
tortured by the duality of its
being, but I shall finally know
peace when I watch the life drain
from your wretched body.
He pulls out a gun and advances towards Rick. As he does, he
bumps into Brad, causing him to spill his drink.
BRAD
Whoa. What’s up, man?
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
It was an accident. I have no
quarrel with you, boy.
Brad gets in his face.
BRAD
Boy? What’s that supposed to mean?
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
It just- Look, I don’t know how you
thought I meant it, but...
Lincoler shoots Rick a “help me out here” look.
RICK
Don’t look at me, dude.
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
Look, I’m half Abraham Lincoln,
so...
BRAD
So... I should get on my knees and
kiss your ass?
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
No, but, you know...
BRAD
What do I know? That the Third
Reich will reign for a thousand
years?
JESSICA
Leave him alone, Brad!
BRAD
Stay out of this, Jessica!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 18.
RICK
Kick his ass, Brad!
Everyone starts chanting for Brad to kick Lincoler’s ass.
ABRODOLPH LINCOLER
Look, let’s talk about thisBrad starts beating the shit out of Lincoler.
JESSICA
Brad!
Jessica runs out of the room.
MORTY
Rick!
RICK
I just did you a favor, Morty. You
can thank me later.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER
Jessica pouts outside. Morty comes out and sits next to her.
MORTY
Sorry about all that. Rick has some
pretty strange friends.
JESSICA
Uch. Brad is such a jerk. He’s
always trying to prove what a man
he is. I’m so sick of those kinds
of guys. I just want to find
somebody nice and sweet.
Morty smiles.
MORTY
Jessica, can I show you something?
INT. MORTY’S HOME - GARAGE - SOON
Morty flips on the light, revealing the workshop. They enter.
Jessica looks around in awe of all the crazy stuff.
JESSICA
This place is incredible.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 19.
MORTY
Yeah, it’s where my grandfather and
I do all our science stuff. Check
this out.
Morty activates a device that creates floating balls of
colored energy that dance around the room and change into
shapes.
JESSICA
It’s beautiful.
MORTY
You know, Jessica, there’s
something I’ve always wanted to
tell you.
She draws closer.
JESSICA
What’s that, Morty?
MORTY
I think that you’re the mostJESSICA
No. That. Those weird sounds coming
from the closet over there.
Morty listens. There’s a rustling sound coming from a STORAGE
CLOSET. Morty slowly walks over and carefully pulls the door
open.
MORTY
Oh!
Inside, he finds Squanchy holding a taut cord wrapped around
his neck while he jerks off his bizarre alien genitalia.
SQUANCHY
Hey! I’m squanching in here!
MORTY
Whoa!
Morty falls backwards into the controls of a TELEPORTATION
MACHINE. It tips over on the floor and starts to spark.
Energy blasts out of it, consuming the entire room.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 20.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
The energy blasts shoots out of the garage and form a huge
sphere centered around the garage, but encompassing the
entire house. A flash. Everything inside the sphere is gone,
leaving a massive dirt hole.
EXT. ALTERNATE DIMENSION - CONTINUOUS
We see a strange alien landscape, with large lumbering lump
monsters roaming about. A flash. The house materializes in
the middle of the scene, complete with the dirt under it.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
The house shakes as it settles into position. Everyone stops
partying. Rick looks outside and surveys the landscape.
RICK
Hmm, big star in the sky.
(inhales)
Oxygen-rich atmosphere.
(observing)
Giant testicle monsters.
He faces the party.
RICK
We’ll be fine, let’s party!
Everyone in the crowd screams “party!” A kid removes his
shirt and runs out the door.
KID
PAAAAARRRRTYYYYYY!
He approaches a lump monster, who, in a quick motion, stuffs
him into a fleshy hole between its giant lumps.
RICK
Uh, did anyone like that guy?
No response. Rick hits the stereo. “Shake that ass” plays.
RICK
Shake that ass, bitch, and let me
see what you got!
Everyone cheers.

ACT TWO
INT. MORTY’S HOME - NIGHT
Morty has cornered Rick and Summer.
MORTY
Rick! We’ve been transported to
another dimension! When mom and dad
come home, we’re gonna be so
screwed!
Rick grabs Morty.
RICK
Pull it together, Morty! Stop
trying to pretend there’s stakes!
MORTY
But what about the house, Rick?!
Where are we?! What are we going to
do?!
RICK
Relax, Morty. Reeelaaaax. It’s
going to be fine. All we have to do
is go out and find us some Kalaxian
crystals. We get some of those and
everything’ll be juuuust fine.
MORTY
Okay. Let’s go, Rick. Let’s go get
those crystals.
RICK
I can’t go with you, Morty. This is
your time to show everyone that
you’re not just some stupid, whiny,
annoying little turd. You’ve got to
show them that you’re a hero.
Morty looks around the room at everyone. He sees Jessica.
MORTY
Okay. I’ll do it.
RICK
Good. Take Lincoler with you.
Lincoler sits in a corner holding an ice pack to his head.
LINCOLER
I’m injured.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 22.
RICK
Shut up, Lincoler. It’s the least
you can do for wrecking the
kitchen.
Lincoler reluctantly gets up and joins Morty.
SUMMER
Nancy, you should go too!
NANCY
What? Why me?
SUMMER
Because...
(she looks at her friends)
Flutes are stupid!
INT. TITANIC 2 - DECK - NIGHT
Passengers run frantically. A customer service line stretches
out the door. The man-made lake is being drained as mechanics
wade through the water. Beth and Jerry are approached by a
“captain.”
CAPTAIN
Sorry for the inconvenience, folks,
we should resume sinking shortly.
In the meantime, please stay on the
ship and enjoy a complimentary
plate of James Cameronion rings.
He exits.
JERRY
Great. Not only is the ship not
sinking, but now the fourth wall’s
been broken.
BETH
I’m going back to the room to
finish my book. You should find
that Lucy woman.
JERRY
It’s true, you do want me to be
with her!
BETH
Jerry, I’m tired, they won’t reopen
the buffet, and I think you’ll have
more fun with someone who’s
interested in Titanic.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 23.
Beth exits. Jerry sees Lucy watching from down the hall. She
approaches.
JERRY
You don’t know what she’s like when
you’re not around.
LUCY
May I show you something, Jerry?
INT. TITANIC 2 - CARGO HOLD - LATER
Lucy is showing Jerry around.
LUCY
Had everything gone as planned,
this entire area would be under
water.
JERRY
I would have liked to see it. This
trip has been a titanic failure.
Get it?
Jerry turns around to see Lucy completely naked except for a
diamond necklace.
LUCY
Draw me, Jerry.
JERRY
Oh boy. Lucy... wow. This... isn’t
what I had in mind.
LUCY
But it’s the perfect moment. We’ve
been dreaming about this for
sixteen years.
JERRY
Not like this. Not with you.
Lucy pulls a gun.
LUCY
You’re going to draw me. Then...
She gestures to an old timey car.
LUCY
...you’re going to fuck me in that
car over there.

EXT. ALTERNATE DIMENSION - STRANGE PLANET - NIGHT
Morty, Lincoler, and Nancy walk through a strange jungle.
Morty uses a beeping device to find the crystals.
MORTY
The crystals should be close.
NANCY
There they are!
A cluster of blue crystals jut out of the ground.
LINCOLER
Wait. Something’s not right...
A BIZARRE CREATURE leaps out in front of them. It’s swift and
moves on all fours.
LINCOLER
Get the crystals! I’ll handle the
beast.
Morty and Nancy go gather the crystals while Lincoler fights
the creature.
NANCY
Summer’s gonna like me again!
Lincoler successfully kills the creature and then collapses
against a rock.
MORTY
Lincoler, come on, let’s get out of
here.
LINCOLER
Mein journey is over, Morty.
Morty looks down to see a giant blood stain on Lincoler’s
belly.
LINCOLER
Morty... I have something important
to tell you...
INT. MORTY’S HOME - SOON
Jessica sits on the couch with Gearhead as he strums an alien
guitar. Morty enters. He’s covered in blood and his clothes
are torn.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 25.
MORTY
(panting)
Rick... I got them... I got the
crystals...
RICK
Alright! You did it, Morty!
Rick takes the crystals and heads off.
MORTY
Rick, wait. There’s something you
need to know.
(as Morty talks, an
emotional score rises)
I couldn’t have done it without
Lincoler. He said that he was sorry
and that he loves you like a
father. He only wanted you to
accept him and he hopes that his
final act would redeem him in your
eyes. He sacrificed himself to save
all of us, Rick. He died.
ANGLE ON: Rick, just as he finishes chopping up the crystals
into a fine powder.
RICK
Huh. Well I have to hand it to
him...
He snorts a big line.
RICK
That’s the first cool thing he ever
did. Wubba lubba dub dub!
(point to the DJ)
Kick it!
The DJ does a record scratch. Rick begins an elaborately
choreographed dance with improvised lyrics.
RICK
You put your right foot forward and
left foot back/
Then slide around like on a Nordic
track/etc.
People start joining in. Birdperson nods his head to the
beat.
Rick’s weirdly mainstream intergalactic rap and weirdly
choreographed but intensely sweaty, tweaky dance continues.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 26.
The last of Summer’s friends join Rick. She’s disgusted at
first, but then eventually joins the rest of the dancers.
The song ends. Everybody claps and cheers.
MORTY
What... the... hell... was that?! I
thought those crystals were
supposed to help us get home or
something!!
RICK
What? No, I can get us home
whenever I want to. But listen,
speaking of those crystals... can I
get the rest of them? I’m starting
to come down, Morty. Crystal
Kalaxian is a strong but fleeting
high.
Morty pulls the pouch of crystals out of his pocket, walks to
the sliding glass door, opens it, and throws them directly
into the gaping mouth of a lumpy beast monster.
MORTY
That’s what I think of your
crystals Rick!
Rick holds his hand to his head. He’s in discomfort.
RICK
Noooo! Morty you idiot!!
(looking around)
Does anyone else have any more KLax? Bird Person? Squanchy?
They shake their heads no. We see the lump monster dancing
around outside.
MORTY
(announcing)
This party is officially over!
Rick, take us home. Now.
RICK
Alright, Captain Buzzkill of the
Starship Party Pooper.
Everybody groans and gives Morty the stink eye. Rick goes out
to the garage.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 27.
INT. TITANIC 2 - NIGHT
Jerry is nervously finishing his sketch.
LUCY
Almost finished, Jerry?
JERRY
Uh... Almost. I haven’t quite
captured your beautiful eyes.
REVEAL: The drawing is terrible.
LUCY
I’m sure It’s good enough.
JERRY
Um... Just a little bit longLucy picks up her gun.
LUCY
Move!
Jerry moves to the car, Lucy nakedly follows.
LUCY
Every weekend Jacks and Roses have
their Titanic experience in this
car, and I have to mop it up. The
floor drops out to make it easier.
Lucy kicks the car and the floor drops. It’s REALLY rusty.
LUCY
But now it’s my turn. We’re going
to get it nice and steamy in there.
And I’m going to slam my hand on
the steam. And then you’re going to
love inside of me. No mess. No
clean.
She pushes him into the car with the gun. A huge hardcover
book comes flying out of nowhere and strikes Lucy’s head. She
falls, unconscious.
REVEAL: BETH stands over her slumped body.
JERRY
Beth!
BETH
Bet you’re glad I think Kindles are
dumb now.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 28.
They embrace. Jerry’s drawing floats onto Lucy’s face.
EXT. PARKING LOT - JUST BEFORE DAWN
Jerry is packing a stockpile of memorabilia into the car.
BETH
I can’t help but feel a little
guilty about what happened. I
didn’t peg Lucy for a rapist.
JERRY
And what does a rapist look like,
exactly, Beth? Is it a Slavic man
wearing a denim jacket with a
patchy beard and the scent of cheap
champagne wafting over his blister
pocked lips?
Beth thinks for a moment then:
BETH
Jerry... this is the first time
someone has tried to rape you,
right?
JERRY
(unconvincing)
Of course.
Beth gets in the driver’s side.
BETH
Well, at least you got all this
free stuff. Should be enough to
satisfy your Titanic jones for
awhile.
Jerry crams the replica door into car, but it’s taking up too
much room in the passenger seat for him to get in.
JERRY
I- I’m not going to fit. You’ll
have to go without me.
Jerry reaches his arms through the window towards Beth, but
she’s just out of his reach. He gazes into her eyes.
JERRY
Beth, listen to me. You’re going to
get out of here. You’re going to go
on and watch our kids grow old.
I... love... you.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 29.
He touches her fingers through the side window and slowly
retreats, mimicking Leo disappearing into the dark sea.
BETH
Jerry, just leave the door. We
don’t have room for it and it
smells bad.
Jerry shrugs.
JERRY
Yeah, okay.
Jerry tosses the door out, climbs in, and Beth starts up the
car.
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
Jerry pulls the diamond necklace out.
JERRY
You’ll always be my Rose, Beth.
He throws the diamond necklace out the window.
EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS
We follow the necklace down to reveal Lucy hanging underneath
the car. She lets out a wild cackle. We hold on her for a
beat, and then the car shifts into drive and begins to move.
Lucy’s fingers instantly slip and she falls to the ground.
The back tire runs over her legs. She doubles over in agony.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
The house zaps through a variety of dimensions. We see all
kinds of crazy shit. It finally gets back to Earth.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - DAWN
Morty holds the door open as everyone leaves.
SQUANCHY
The party squanches on at my place!
Everyone cheers.
SUMMER
Cool! I’m coming too!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 30.
SQUANCHY
No. You’re not squanchy enough for
a squanchy party.
SUMMER
What?
(summer looks around)
Guys? Seriously?
BRAD
He’s right, Summer. We all hate
people who throw parties that end
too soon. Later.
Brad and the last of the party goers leave. Morty slams the
door. Summer slumps over to Rick, who appears to be passed
out on the couch.
SUMMER
Okay. You were right, Grandpa Rick.
Next party, I’m just going to have
a good time. Screw other people.
RICK
(Inaudible mumble)
Summer exits. Morty cleans up. Birdperson approaches him.
BIRDPERSON
May I assist you with that?
MORTY
Uh, sure, thanks.
Birdperson puts bottles into a garbage bag.
BIRDPERSON
Morty, do you know what “Wubba
lubba dub dubs” means?
MORTY
Rick’s stupid nonsense catchphrase.
BIRDPERSON
It’s not nonsense at all. In my
people’s tongue it means: “I am in
great pain. Please help me.”
MORTY
Well I got news for you, he’s
saying it ironically.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 31.
BIRDPERSON
No, Morty, your grandfather is
indeed in very deep pain. The
things he has seen in the universe.
The knowledge he has. It has all
left a hole deep in his soul that
nothing can fill. That is why he
must numb himself.
Morty looks over at Rick snoring on the floor.
MORTY
Come on, um...
BIRDPERSON
Birdperson.
MORTY
Come on, Birdperson, Rick’s not
that complicated. He’s just an
asshole.
BIRDPERSON
Then why do you care so much if you
are no longer allowed to continue
on your adventures together? It
appears fate has presented you with
an opportunity to free yourself of
Rick forever.
MORTY
You’re right. I shouldn’t care.
This is probably the best thing
that could happen to me. I’m sick
of having adventures with Rick.
BIRDPERSON
My people have another saying:
“Gubba nub nub doo rah kah.” It
means “whatever lets you sleep at
night.”
Summer runs in.
SUMMER
Mom and Dad are home!!
BIRDPERSON
This is your moment, Morty. Before
you are two very different paths.
Choose wisely.
(yells off screen)
Tammy!!
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 32.
Tammy runs in and jumps on his back. He flaps his wings and
they fly away.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Beth’s car pulls into the driveway.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Summer runs around trying to clean the house up.
SUMMER
We are so screwed!!!!
Morty looks from Summer to Rick on the couch. He goes over
and shakes him.
MORTY
Rick! Rick! Wake up!
Rick swats him away.
MORTY
Rick, you gotta do something quick.
My parents are home.
Rick sits up on the couch and rubs his temples.
RICK
Alright. Hold on.
Morty looks out a window. Rick takes a long sip from a glass
of water.
RICK
Um. So good.
MORTY
They’re walking up the driveway!
RICK
(snaps his fingers)
Bring me the thing...
MORTY
What thing?
RICK
The thing, the thing. It’s got the
buttons and the lights. It beeps.
Come on, Morty, you know what I’m
talking about. The thing.
RAM 110 "RICKSY BUSINESS" NETWORK DRAFT (5/10/13) 33.
MORTY
Rick, that describes everything in
your garage.
Summer runs in holding a DOODAD.
SUMMER
Do you mean this?
RICK
Summer with the win.
Rick activates the doodad. It lights up and makes some beeps.
A pulse ripples through the living room.
RICK
That should do it.
MORTY
What did you do?
RICK
See for yourself.
Morty opens the door to reveal BETH and JERRY frozen.
SUMMER
Whoa...
RICK
Everything is frozen in time. The
whole world.
MORTY
For how long?
RICK
How long do you want? A week? A
month?
SUMMER
Can we start cleaning the house and
see how we feel?
EXT./INT. - CLEANING MONTAGE
They spend the next three months cleaning the house, playing
around in the frozen world and getting to know each other.

EXT. HILLTOP OVERLOOKING TOWN - DAWN
A sunrise is frozen in the sky. Rick, Morty, and Summer sit
in front of a television connected to hundreds of extension
cords. On screen, the credits for Titanic are rolling.
RICK/MORTY/SUMMER
Dumb.
They all laugh.
SUMMER
This has been so much fun. I’m
almost over being somewhat
responsible for Nancy’s death.
RICK
Yeah, I have to say, it’s pretty
nice hanging out with my grand
kids.
MORTY
Hey, Rick, you know, I haven’t
heard you say that “Wubba lubba dub
dub” thing you say this whole time.
RICK
Don’t need to. I have a new catch
phrase.
MORTY
What’s that, Rick?
RICK
I love my grand kids.
MORTY
(simultaneously)
Awww...
SUMMER
(simultaneously)
Ohhh...
They all hug.
RICK
Just kidding. You’re both gay.
TEN MINUTES LATER
Birdperson lands next to Rick in an empty lot.

BIRDPERSON
The beacon was activatedRick starts hitting him.
RICK
You told my grandson about “Wubba

bitch!
BIRDPERSON
I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
A cartoon iris closes around them as Rick kicks Birdperson in
the shins.
