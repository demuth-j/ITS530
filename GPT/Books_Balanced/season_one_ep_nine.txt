COLD OPEN:
INT. MORTY’S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY
Rick, Jerry and Beth at breakfast. Rick fiddles with
electronics at the table, shooting sparks in Jerry’s face as
he tries to read his iPad. Morty enters.
MORTY 1
Hey, Rick, I have to make a project
for the science fair this weekend,
think you could help me out?
RICK 2
Whatever.
JERRY 3
Well. Traditionally, science fairs
are a father/son thing.
RICK 4
Well, scientifically, traditions
are an idiot thing.
Beth types on her phone while talking.
BETH 5
Morty, I think it would be fun for
you to work on a science project
with your Dad.
Morty gets a text message. He looks at his phone.
CLOSE: MORTY’S PHONE
It’s a text message from “Mom.” It says “YOUR FATHER IS
INSECURE ABOUT HIS INTELLIGENCE.”
MORTY 6
(clears throat)
Yeah, Dad, why don’t we do it
together?
JERRY 7
YES. You backed the right horse on
this one, son. We’ll get out the
crayons, brew some coffee and knock
this thing out in two or three
days.
Rick finishes what he’s been making - a SMALL ROBOT. He turns
it on.

SMALL ROBOT 8
What is my purpose?
RICK 9
Pass the butter.
While Morty watches, the robot walks across the kitchen table
to the butter and pulls it to Rick. Rick spreads it on his
pancakes nonchalantly.
RICK (CONT’D) 10
Thank yewwwww.
10A Morty looks at Rick spreading his butter. He looks at Jerry
and sighs.
Summer enters with her bag.
SUMMER 11
I need a ride to work.
JERRY 12
(proud)
Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I’m
helping Morty with science.
RICK 13
Come on. I have bigger fish to fry.
SUMMER 14
Like what?
RICK 15
Like anything.
They mad dog each other. Summer loses the staring contest.
SMALL ROBOT 16
What is my purpose?
RICK 17
You pass butter.
The robot looks around. He looks at his own hands.
SMALL ROBOT 18
(existential defeat)
Butter.
RICK 19
(eating pancakes)
Welcome to the club, pal.

ACT ONE
INT. RICK’S FLYING CAR - SOON
Rick drinks and flies while Summer sits, arms folded, looking
out the window.
RICK 20
Where is it?
SUMMER 21
Downtown.
RICK 22
Terrific.
(pause)
Since when do you have a job?
SUMMER 23
Since last week. It’s part-time at
this little vintage thrift store...
(pointed)
My boss is this really smart,
eccentric old man that treats me
nice and values me.
RICK 24
Smart and eccentric. Heh. That
reminds me of this morning, I
wanted some butter, and instead of
grabbing it, I built an entire -
SUMMER 25
(curt)
- Can you step on it a little?
Thank you. Mr. Needful likes me to
get there before he opens.
RICK 26
Me-ow. Can’t wait to meet this
fascinating character.
SUMMER 27
Please don’t.
INT. NEEDFUL THINGS - DAY
Cluttered shelves hold miss-matched magical items. Music
boxes, Native American masks, a stuffed cat, guitars, mirrors
etc. MR. NEEDFUL, svelte and charming, feather dusts his
inventory as Mr. GOLDENFOLD enters.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 3.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 28
Oh... when did this stop being
Jamba Juice?
MR. NEEDFUL 29
I’ve just recently opened for
business, Mister... Goldenfold,
isn’t it?
MR. GOLDENFOLD 30
You know my name? That’s disarming.
MR. NEEDFUL 31
I also know you long for female
company.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 32
It has been... lonely since the
divorce. Some voids can’t be filled
with Jamba Juice.
Mr. Needful pulls a small bottle from a conveniently nearby
shelf.
MR. NEEDFUL 33
This aftershave makes a man quite
irresistible to women. Free of
charge. One never pays here. Not
with money.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 34
Nothing to read into there! Thanks!
Mr. Goldenfold takes the bottle and happily leaves as Summer
and Rick enter.
SUMMER 35
Sorry I’m late, Mr. Needful. I’ll
just dust random shelves like
yesterday? This is my Grandpa Rick,
he was just leaving.
RICK 36
Hm.
Summer starts dusting shelves as Rick examines items.
MR. NEEDFUL 37
Tell me, Rick, what do you desire?
RICK 38
Eh. I make my own stuff.
(looks around, then)
So, what are you, like, the Devil?
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 4.
MR. NEEDFUL 39
What? Sorry?
RICK 40
I don’t know, store comes out of
nowhere, all the shit’s old and
creepy, you got the sweater and the
fancy talk, are you the Devil? a
demon? Leprechaun?
SUMMER 41
Grandpa Rick! Rude.
RICK 42
I’m not judging, I just like to
shoot straight, I’m a man of
science.
MR. NEEDFUL 43
Ah! then perhaps you could make use
of this.
Needful picks up a GOLDEN MICROSCOPE and offers it to Rick.
MR. NEEDFUL (CONT’D) 44
This microscope reveals things
beyond comprehension.
RICK 45
Mr. Needful, there ain’t much
beyond my comprehension.
45A Mr. Needful chuckles.
MR. NEEDFUL 46
Perhaps that will change.
46A,B,C Needful chuckles. Rick chuckles with him. They try to outchuckle each other.
SUMMER 47
Grandpa, go home and drink.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jerry and Morty are on the floor with a spread of arts and
crafts supplies.
JERRY 48
Why don’t we do a model of the
solar system? That’s what my dad
did with me when I was your age.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 5.
MORTY 49
Okay.
JERRY 50
You know, Rick’s in his lab making
cyborgs and wormholes and all that
weird stuff, but this is real
science. A man and his boy, makin’
planets. How about we use a ping
pong ball for Pluto, and then
Jupiter could be -
MORTY 51
Uh. I don’t think Pluto’s a planet.
JERRY 52
(chuckling)
Of course Pluto’s a planet, son. I
learned that in the third grade.
MORTY 53
Yeah, but they changed it.
JERRY 54
Morty, nobody “changed” the planetsMorty holds up his phone.
MORTY 55
I googled it. Pluto’s not a planet,
they changed it in 2006.
Jerry stares at Morty a while. He makes a big decision.
JERRY 56
(lying)
I heard about that, Morty.
(deciding)
And I disagree.
MORTY 57
You disagree?
JERRY 58
That’s right. It’s possible to
disagree in science, Morty. Pluto
was a planet, some committee of
fancy assholes disagree, I disagree
back, give me a ping pong ball.
MORTY 59
Um. Okay. I just have to -
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 6.
JERRY 60
(nervous snapping)
- Go find Rick and go over my head
about Pluto?
MORTY 61
Go to the bathroom!
JERRY 62
(composing himself)
Okay good. This is gonna be fun!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - GARAGE - DAY
Rick has the golden microscope on a centralized platform and
is putting the finishing touches on a man-sized rig with
cameras for eyes in front of it. Morty passes by the door.
RICK 63
Hey, Morty, let me ask you a
question. Does evil exist, and if
so, can one detect and measure it?
MORTY 64
Uh...
Rick activates his machine. Lasers scan the golden
microscope.
RICK 65
Rhetorical question, Morty, the
answer is yes, you just have to be
a genius.
The robotic rig “looks” through its eyepiece. Data starts
scrolling across a laptop’s screen. Rick reads it.
RICK (CONT’D) 66
Cute.
(pointing at screen)
Your sister’s boss gave me a
microscope that would have made me
retarded.
MORTY 67
I don’t think you’re allowed to say
that, Rick.
RICK 68
I’m not disparaging the differently
abled, Morty.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 7.
(MORE)
I’m stating the fact that if I had
used this microscope, it would have
made me mentally retarded.
MORTY 69
I don’t think it’s about logic, I
think that word has just become a
symbolic issue for powerful groups
that feel like they’re doing the
right thing.
RICK 70
Well, that’s retarded.
Jerry enters, suspicious.
JERRY 71
What are you guys talking about?
RICK 72
Apparently nothing.
JERRY 73
You asked him if Pluto’s a planet,
didn’t you?
MORTY 74
No.
RICK 75
It’s not.
JERRY 76
Shut up, Rick!
RICK 77
Whoa.
JERRY 78
I don’t care what anyone says. It’s
not up for debate, if it can be a
planet, and then stop being a
planet, it can be a planet again.
Planet. Planet planet planet!
Jerry storms off.
RICK 79
Stay scientific, Jerry.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 8.
RICK (CONT'D)
INT. NEEDFUL THINGS - DAY
Summer is dusting. Needful is behind the counter. Goldenfold
enters the store, looking strung out and angry, with
attractive women following him. He storms up to Mr. Needful.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 80
This aftershave made women want me
but it also made me impotent!
Mr. Needful teepees his fingers and darkens his brow.
MR. NEEDFUL 81
A price for everything, Mr.
Goldenfold. A price for everything.
81A Mr. Needful laughs. Summer looks uncomfortable but keeps
dusting. Goldenfold throws his arms to the sky and falls to
his knees.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 82
(wailing at the sky)
Oh my God! How could I not see this
coming! My lust! My greed! I
deserved this!
Rick steps into frame and injects Goldenfold with a syringe.
Goldenfold stops crying.
RICK 83
That serum should counteract the
negative effects.
Goldenfold looks down at his pants.
MR. GOLDENFOLD 84
Holy cats! Ladies, let’s do this!
He runs out of the store with his ladies.
MR. GOLDENFOLD (CONT’D) 85
(distant)
I haven’t learned a thing!
Rick slams the golden microscope on the counter with a
dramatic thud.
RICK 86
You can have this back.
MR. NEEDFUL 87
You didn’t... use it?
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 9.
RICK 88
Sure I did. To develop this.
Rick holds up a tricorder device.
RICK (CONT’D) 89
It detects and catalogues all your
Twilight Zone, Ray Bradbury, Friday
the Thirteenth the Series voodoo
crap magic. I thought you might
want it, so you didn’t accidentally
sell anybody, sayHe points his tricorder at a nearby typewriter.
RICK (CONT’D) 90
A typewriter that generates
bestselling murder mysteries... and
then makes the murders happen in
real life, ooooo.
MR. NEEDFUL 91
Be quiet!
RICK 92
Don’t you want to make sure people
know what they’re getting? You’re
not intentionally selling
(reads device)
-beauty cream that makes ugly
ladies pretty but also makes them
BLIND?
An ugly woman drops some cream and leaves the store.
MR. NEEDFUL 93
I find this all quite preposterous.
RICK 94
(mocking him)
Oh, I say, good sir, I do so find
your manner of speaking so very
quite tallyho.
Rick scans a mink stole that a woman is trying on.
RICK (CONT’D) 95
That’s beautiful. You know it’s
going to be wearing YOU in three
hours.
The woman drops it. She and other customers file out of the
store.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 10.
MR. NEEDFUL 96
Do I need to call the police?
Rick holds up his cell phone.
RICK 97
Sure. Call the Better Business
Bureau, too. Call the FBI. Use my
phone. Don’t worry, it won’t make
you deaf because I’m not a hack.
97A Needful slaps Rick’s phone out of his hand. Rick slaps back
defensively at Needful. They get into a SLAP FIGHT.
SUMMER 98
(appalled)
Stop it! Stop it right now!
(separating them)
Grandpa Rick, I like working here!
RICK 99
You work for the Devil!
SUMMER 100
So what?!
RICK AND NEEDFUL 101
So what?
Rick and Needful are equally thrown to hear her say this.
SUMMER 102
Yes, so what if he’s the Devil,
Rick? At least the Devil has a job.
At least he’s active in the
community. What do you do? You eat
our food and make gadgets.
(SNL)
Buh-bye.
Rick is visibly stung. He composes himself and leaves the
store. On his way out, he deliberately knocks over a vase
just to be a dick.
RICK 103
Whoops.
103A The spirit of a 19th century woman emerges from the shards
and wails as she ascends into the ceiling.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 11.
SUMMER 104
I’m sorry, Mr. Needful. I’ll clean
that up, I don’t know what I can do
about the ghost lady that came out
of it -
MR. NEEDFUL 105
It’s fine.
(then)
Summer... you know your
grandfather’s right. This store
curses people. That’s my business.
SUMMER 106
Well, yeah, and McDonald’s gives
people diabetes and The Gap has
sweatshops. Is there a company
hiring teenagers that isn’t evil?
This is my first job. You’ve been
nice to me, Mr. Needful. You
respect me.
MR. NEEDFUL 107
Please. Call me The Devil.
Pause.
SUMMER 108
(simultaneously)
I’d rather not, actually.
MR. NEEDFUL 109
(simultaneously)
Yeah, maybe not during business
hours.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - DAY
Beth is getting ready for work. Morty depressingly paints a
Styrofoam Saturn while Jerry paces on his phone.
JERRY 110
Then connect me with someone that
can. I told you, I want to file a
declaration that Pluto is a planet.
Well then my son’s going to fail
his science class, and when that
happens, I’m suing you first.
(hanging up)
I think I know what the “A” in NASA
stands for.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 12.
BETH 111
Jerry, what’s your end game?
JERRY 112
Ain’t no game, sucka.
BETH 113
Sorry, Morty. I’m going to work.
She leaves.
MORTY 114
Dad, why don’t we just make a solar
system with eight planets, it’s
even easier.
JERRY 115
Sure, sure, and why don’t we just
burn Galileo at the stake for
saying the sun is round. Science
isn’t always easy, Morty.
Before Morty can answer, the table rattles. The lights
flicker.
115A Morty and Jerry are abruptly sucked up from their chairs,
where they hover in the air, panicking.
EXT. SMITH HOUSE - DAY
A large flying saucer is hovering over the Smith house. It
sucks a chunk of the roof into its cargo bay via tractor
beam, followed by Jerry and Morty. It takes off into the
night sky.
EXT. SPACE - PLUTO - SOON
The flying saucer heads to Pluto.
EXT. PLUTONIAN CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
An official looking building sits on a Plutonian skyline.
INT. PLUTONIAN CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY
The Plutonian capital building is icy and on the small side,
but the inhabitants are regular sized. Jerry and Morty,
frightened, are led by two suit-clad secret service aliens
into the King’s chamber.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 13.
KING FLIPPY NIPS, the Plutonian king, gets up from behind his
desk at the end of the chamber. He strides over to Jerry.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 116
I’m King Flippy Nips, ruler of
Pluto. You’re Jerry and Morty
Smith, from Earth.
JERRY 117
(simultaneously)
I, yes, sir, majesty.
MORTY 118
(simultaneously)
Yes, sir.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 119
We discovered you quite by accident
during routine surveillance of your
world. You really gave it to those
guys at NASA.
JERRY 120
I was... you know, sometimes,
science is about conviction.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 121
If you don’t mind, I’d like to
introduce you to a few people that
very much agree with you.
JERRY 122
Oh. I...
122A Flippy Nips takes Jerry to a side window, which opens to a
balcony with a microphone on it. A tumultuous crowd of no
less than five hundred thousand aliens comes to silence.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 123
(into microphone)
Plutonians. Jerry Smith is a
scientist from Earth, where he’s
creating a model of our solar
system. Jerry, tell Pluto about
your decision.
123A Jerry clears his throat into the microphone.
JERRY 124
Um. Pluto’s a planet.
124A The crowd ERUPTS into cheering and applause. King Flippy Nips
holds Jerry’s hand up like he’s a boxer that just won a
fight.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 14.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 125
Pluto’s a fucking PLANET!!
125A The crowd cheers again. Jerry very quickly gets used to it.
Morty observes from inside the King’s chamber. He rubs his
eyes.
MORTY 126
Well, this is going to go to his
head.
END ACT ONE
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 15.
ACT TWO
INT. NEEDFUL THINGS - DAY
Mr. Needful tends to a customer.
MR. NEEDFUL 127
If it’s athletic prowess you
desire, Principal Vagina, might I
suggest -
PRINCIPAL VAGINA 128
I’ll take it!
MR. NEEDFUL 129
Well, I haven’t even -
Mr. Needful was about to reach for a basketball on a shelf.
Vagina grabs it before he does.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA 130
It’s cool, I want it, I deserve
whatever happens, bye!
MISTER NEEDFUL 131
Uh. Okay -
Vagina leaves with his basketball.
MR. NEEDFUL 132
I must say, Summer, I thought your
grandfather’s outburst would have
disrupted business, but this is the
best weekend I’ve had since Salem.
SUMMER 133
Nice. Wholesome Delight for lunch?
MR. NEEDFUL 134
Is that the vegan place?
SUMMER 135
Yeah, I love their soup.
MR. NEEDFUL 136
I’m kind of souped out -
MRS. TATE enters and starts just grabbing shit off the
shelves.
MR. NEEDFUL (CONT’D) 137
Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you
desire - whoa, slow down, honey.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 16.
MRS. TATE 138
Oh, is there a limit? Everything’s
free, right?
SUMMER 139
(I got this)
Let’s just say you don’t pay...
with money.
139A,B Summer and Needful chuckle together. They have a great
relationship.
MRS. TATE 140
Right, yeah, you pay with the
curses, right? So, more stuff, more
curses, that’s okay, right?
MR. NEEDFUL 141
Um. I. Well, I suppose it’s fine -
(as she leaves)
But Mrs. Tate: why do you want
cursed items?
MRS. TATE 142
I’m gonna get the curses removed!
At Curse Purge Plus. The guy on TV?
She walks out. Mr. Needful, concerned, walks to a TV and
flips it on.
COMMERCIAL:
INT. CURSE PURGE PLUS - DAY
Rick is in a mechanic’s car-repair suit.
RICK 143
Have you acquired, creepy, specific
old stuff from a mysterious antique
or thrift store that gives you
powers but fucks with you in
unforeseeable ways?
Rick walks to in front of a workbench full of items.
RICK (CONT’D) 144
Bring it to Curse Purge Plus. I use
science to uncurse items for cash,
and you keep the powers!
Rick steps up to a happy CUSTOMER, who holds up a pair of
Chuck Taylors.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 17.
RICK (CONT’D) 145
This guy got these mysterious
sneakers to make him run faster.
But he would have run until he
died, making them worthless. I
removed the curse, making them
worth like, I don’t know, eight
million dollars?
(pats guy on back)
See you at the Olympics.
He walks up to another customer, holding a doll.
RICK (CONT’D) 146
This eerily intelligent doll was
threatening to murder its family.
Now it does their taxes.
Customer 2 pulls the doll’s string.
TALKING DOLL 147
Everything’s deductible.
RICK 148
Don’t pay for cool stuff with your
soul. Pay for it with money, you
know, like how every store in the
world works? We’re located at first
and main in old town.
MR. NEEDFUL 149
First and...?
Needful runs over to the window and lifts the blinds.
EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - CONTINUOUS
Rick’s CURSE PURGE PLUS store is across the street from
Needful Things, and has a long line of Needful’s customers
snaking out the door. Rick stands beside a wind-sock man,
mimicking its wacky movements as he flips Mr. Needful off.
RICK 150
(across the street)
Whubble lubble dub dub!
RICK (V.O.) 151
(on TV)
That’s right across the street from
Needful Things, where you can get
evil items for freeeeeee!
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 18.
MR. NEEDFUL 152
Diabolical son of a mother -
The door SLAMS open. Customers flood in and start filling
their arms with random shit. It’s pretty much just a looting.
INT. PLUTO - GOOD MORNING PLUTO SET - DAY
The set of a morning chat show on Pluto, with Jerry sitting
between two Plutonian chat show hosts.
PLUTONIAN CHAT SHOW HOST 1 153
We’re back on Good Morning Pluto
and a very good morning it is for
our guest, Earth scientist Jerry
Smith, who’s making headlines with
his bold announcement that is what,
Jerry?
JERRY 154
(proudly)
Pluto is a planet.
PLUTONIAN CHAT SHOW HOST 2 155
And how do we know that for sure,
Jerry?
JERRY 156
On Earth, we have a saying. “My
Very Eager Mother Just Served Us
Nine Pickles.” The pickles is
Pluto.
The hosts are impressed.
JERRY (CONT’D) 157
So if Pluto isn’t a planet, then I
guess we’re all going hungry, and
that’s not a very eager mother in
my book!
157A People laugh and applaud on the set.
PLUTONIAN CHAT SHOW HOST 1 158
Wow. I love it.
JERRY 159
I just want to give a shout out to
my son, Morty. Morty, I hate to say
it, but I told ya so!
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 19.
Morty is watching this from behind the scenes on the sound
stage, bewildered. SCROOPY NOOPERS, a fat, nerdy Plutonian
scientist, approaches him.
SCROOPY NOOPERS 160
Morty Smith? I’m Scroopy Noopers.
I’m a scientist. Can I show you
something?
(looks down)
Right now?
Morty looks down to see Scroopy Noopers is holding a gun on
him.
INT. THE PLUTONIAN CORE - CONTINUOUS
Morty is escorted through a door into a cavern by Scroopy
Noopers.
SCROOPY NOOPERS 161
The center of Pluto, Mister Smith,
is made of a substance called
Plutonium.
He points at armatures coming down through the cavern,
sucking up glowing blue fluid.
SCROOPY NOOPERS (CONT’D) 162
Mines like these suck Plutonium up
to the cities, where corporations
use it to power everything, from
diamond cars to golden showers. And
the more we remove, the more Pluto
shrinks.
A quake rumbles.
SCROOPY NOOPERS (CONT’D) 163
There it goes again. It just shrank
a little.
MORTY 164
Oh, yeah, I think that rock got
closer to that rock.
SCROOPY NOOPERS 165
Well don’t be stupid, you can’t see
it that much. But a few years ago,
your scientists noticed Pluto had
gotten so small they couldn’t even
call it a planet anymore. It should
have been our wakeup call. But the
rich Plutonians won’t wake up.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 20.
(MORE)
And they love your Dad telling
everyone Pluto’s a planet, because
that means they can keep mining,
until Pluto goes from planet to
asteroid to meteor and finally:
165A Scroopy Noopers opens his palm and blows a puff of dust into
the air.
MORTY 166
...a party?
SCROOPY NOOPERS 167
No, dust, is everyone in your
family an idiot?!
MORTY 168
Almost, yeah! I mean, definitely me
and my dad are!
SCROOPY NOOPERS 169
Well, all you have to do is get him
to admit that and you could save
four billion lives.
MORTY 170
Yeah... uh... the thing is, my
dad’s really insecure.
INT. NEEDFUL THINGS - DAY
Summer finishes sweeping debris into a pile. The store’s
shelves are all but empty. She finds a lone monkey’s paw.
SUMMER 171
Funny.
INT. NEEDFUL THINGS - BACK ROOM - SECONDS LATER
We’re looking at the door to Mr. Needful’s antiquated office.
We can hear Summer approaching from within the store.
SUMMER (O.S.) 172
Mister Needful, out of everything
in the store, you’ll never guess
what we couldn’t get rid of -
Summer has entered the office and now sees:
Mr. Needful has used his own belt to hang himself from the
rafters.

SCROOPY NOOPERS (CONT'D)
172A Summer shrieks. She drops the monkey paw, runs to him and
tries to lift his body. He’s too heavy.
She runs to his desk and tries to push it under his legs.
It’s also too heavy.
She runs to the monkey paw and grabs it.
SUMMER (CONT’D) 173
I wish this desk was lighter!
She runs back to the desk and effortlessly shoves it under
Needful’s legs. She climbs up on the desk and tries to untie
his neck. She grabs the monkey paw again.
SUMMER (CONT’D) 174
I wish this knot was looser!
Needful’s body drops from the rafters onto the desk. Summer
gets down and tries to give him CPR but doesn’t know what
she’s doing. Ominous BLACK CRACKS form in the ground.
SUMMER (CONT’D) 175
(realizing)
Wait, what am I doing?!
(using monkey paw)
I wish I knew CPR!
175A Summer expertly performs CPR on Mister Needful and revives
him. He coughs and sputters to life. The black cracks close
up.
MR. NEEDFUL 176
(coughing)
Jesus, what a waste of a monkey
paw.
SUMMER 177
Mr. Needful, how could you even
think of doing something so
horrible?
MR. NEEDFUL 178
I’m the Devil, what should I do
when I fail, give myself an ice
cream?
SUMMER 179
You haven’t failed!
MR. NEEDFUL 180
There’s no place for me here
anymore, people like Rick are
making me obsolete.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 22.
(MORE)
I mean, seriously, I may be the
Devil, but your grandpa is the
Devil. I just want to go back to
Hell where everyone thinks I’m
smart and funny.
SUMMER 181
No! It’s not fair. Everyone in this
town got something they wanted from
you. Even Rick. I was your only
friend, and I get nothing?
MR. NEEDFUL 182
Okay, I’ll give you one thing. Name
it.
SUMMER 183
I want to help you.
MR. NEEDFUL 184
(impressed)
Clever twist.
SUMMER 185
I learned from the best, you old
fart,
(helps him to his feet)
Now let’s go get you hydrated.
INT. CURSE PURGE PLUS - SOON
Rick, in a black turtle neck, examines someone’s pair of
antique boxing gloves with his tricorder.
RICK 186
Looks like we’ve got... haunted
boxing gloves that will make you
the heavyweight champion ...in
nineteen thirty six, and you’ll be
trapped there, winning the same
fight for eternity. I can take out
the eternity and the padding and
you’ll have time traveling mittens.
Summer enters with a cardboard box.
RICK (CONT’D) 187
(smug)
Oh, look, it’s Rosemary’s baby.
How’s business?
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 23.
MR. NEEDFUL (CONT'D)
SUMMER 188
Here’s the last of our inventory.
(drops box)
We’re going to file chapter eleven
and do some restructuring.
RICK 189
Sounds like code for “you win,
Rick.”
SUMMER 190
That was important to you, right?
RICK 191
Nope. It was important to your dumb
devil friend. To me, this was all
just a bit, like when Bugs Bunny
fucks with the opera singer for
twenty minutes.
SUMMER 192
He tried to kill himself.
RICK 193
(suppressing orgasm)
Seriously? Holy crap.
(impressed with himself)
Holy. Crap.
SUMMER 194
But you know what? He’s strong and
he’s never going to give up.
RICK 195
I don’t care.
SUMMER 196
I know. Everyone knows you don’t
care.
RICK 197
So?
SUMMER 198
So, have fun not caring.
RICK 199
I always do.
SUMMER 200
Good.
RICK 201
It is good. It’s the best.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 24.
SUMMER 202
I’m sure it is. Bye.
RICK 203
Later.
Rick watches her go, then turns back to the line of people
waiting with their items. The guy at the front is holding a
receipt.
GUY 204
I’m here to pick up my undead cat
and child?
RICK 205
Yeah. Uh. Gimme a sec.
Rick goes behind a counter. His smugness is gone. A teenage
employee walks up with a stack of papers.
TEENAGER EMPLOYEE 206
These are the forms for the
employee health plan?
RICK 207
Okay, put them on my ...
(deciding)
Eh.
Rick picks up a gas can and starts emptying it onto the
counter and floor.
RICK (CONT’D) 208
(announcing)
I just got bored. Everybody out.
INT. PLUTONIAN LIMOUSINE - DAY
Morty and Jerry are dressed in tuxedos, heading to a party in
a Plutonian limo.
JERRY 209
All right, just one more rally,
then I promise we’ll get back to
your science project.
MORTY 210
Dad. Pluto isn’t a planet, it’s
shrinking because of corporations -
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 25.
JERRY 211
-Yeah yeah, some homeless guy was
screaming about this outside the
ministry of money’s fundraiser.
MORTY 212
I’ve talked to real scientists,
Dad, I’ve seen the evidence -
JERRY 213
You’ve talked to radicals, Morty.
What do you call them, activists,
hippies, Muslims or whatever. Are
you telling me four billion
Plutonians are wrong?
MORTY 214
You said science wasn’t easy!
JERRY 215
I said science isn’t always easy.
Obviously that means sometimes it
is easy, let’s not debase ourselves
with word games.
MORTY 216
Dad, their whole planet is dying -
JERRY 217
- Ha! You called it a planet. Check
mate.
The car comes to a stop at a red carpet surrounded by alien
paparazzi. Jerry hops out.
JERRY (CONT’D) 218
Whazzup Pluto!
218A The crowd cheers.
INT. ELITIST PLUTO PARTY - DAY
Jerry sips a martini and rubs elbows with the Pluto elite.
RICH PLUTOCRAT 219
(pulling in a friend)
Mr. Smith, tell my friend here what
you just told me.
JERRY 220
Well, I was just saying that Pluto
is, and always will be, a planet.

220A The Plutocrat’s FRIEND spit-takes martini in astonishment.
PLUTOCRAT’S FRIEND 221
My god. This man is a genius!
MORTY 222
(raising his voice)
Excuse me?
(he taps his champagne
flute with a fork)
Excuse me, Dad?
JERRY 223
Morty, what?
MORTY 224
(loud)
Dad, what did you think about the
recent report published by Scroopy
Noopers linking-
(reading a cheat sheet)
Earthquakes, sinkholes and surface
shrinkage to deep core Plutonium
drilling?
Everyone looks at Jerry. He makes a decision.
JERRY 225
Well, son, what did you think when
you were five, and you pooped your
pants, and you threw your poopy
undies out your bedroom window
because you thought it was like
throwing something in the garbage?
225A Everyone laughs. Morty is astonished by his father.
JERRY (CONT’D) 226
I mean, I’m trimming the hedges and
these things are just hanging
there, was I supposed to think the
poop bunny left them?
226A The crowd laughs at Morty’s expense. Morty hops off the chair
and leaves the party.
MORTY 227
(sad)
Good one, dad.

INT. MORTY’S HOME - KITCHEN TABLE - SOON
Rick eats a TV dinner.
The butter-passing robot walks into frame, offering Rick
butter.
RICK 232
Thanks.
He tosses it in the trash. The robot starts to walk away.
RICK (CONT’D) 233
I was thinking I might watch a
movie.
SMALL ROBOT 234
My purpose is to pass butter.
Rick takes a deep swig of his whiskey.

Suit yourself.
Morty walks in. Rick almost fails to contain his excitement.
RICK (CONT’D) 236
Hey.
MORTY 237
Hey. Can you help me do a project
for the science fair?
RICK 238
(shrug)
Whatever.
INT. PLUTO - KING’S CHAMBER - DAY
King Flippy Nips observes while Jerry is tended to by
assistants.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 239
You must be excited, Jerry. The
Plutobel Prize is the highest honor
a scientist can receive.
JERRY 240
I’m flattered and humbled.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 241
Oh, I like that. Use that in your
speech. Also, talk about Pluto
being a planet, people like that.
Plutonian police drag a handcuffed Scroopy Noopers into the
chamber.
KING FLIPPY NIPS (CONT’D) 242
Ah. It appears your journey’s come
to an end, young man. Take him to
Plutanamo Bay.
As Scroopy Noopers is dragged out:
SCROOPY NOOPERS 243
You can’t kill the truth, father!
Jerry is perplexed.
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 29.
KING FLIPPY NIPS 244
I can see you’re confused.
Plutanamo Bay is a military prison,
not unlike your planet’s
“Guantanamo” -
JERRY 245
Did he call you father? Scroopy
Noopers is your son?
KING FLIPPY NIPS 246
The young eat the old if you let
them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold
celestial dwarf.
JERRY 247
It’s a what?
KING FLIPPY NIPS 248
Hm? Oh, planet! Ha, Pluto is a
cold, cold planet, hey, knock ‘em
dead out there.
INT. PLUTO - PARLIAMENT LAWN - DAY
Jerry is at a podium, giving a speech under a “MASTER OF ALL
SCIENCE” banner. His single note card says “Pluto = Planet.”
He looks at the crowd.
JERRY 249
Pluto... is...
Jerry sees at Plutonian kid who looks a lot like Morty in the
crowd. A tear wells in his eye.
JERRY (CONT’D) 250

Not a planet.

JERRY (CONT’D) 251

Summer and Mr. Needful stand before a crowd of young
bloggers. Needful is wearing socks, sandals and a hoody,
holding a sports drink.
MR. NEEDFUL 252
It was a long six hours, but we’ve
overhauled Needful Things into the
globally compliant, web 4.0 enomenon, N33dful.com! Spelled with
threes instead of E’s! Now the

also accept bitcoin!

reads it.
MR. NEEDFUL (CONT’D) 253
Okay, Google bought us! Everybody
celebrate!
Hip music starts and everyone starts partying. Summer hugs
Needful.
SUMMER 254
I’m so proud of you, Lucius. So...
how much did we make?
MR. NEEDFUL 255
We? This is my business.

But it was my idea.

And you got what you wanted,
Summer. You got to help me.

Security?
Guards start hauling Summer away.

You’re Zuckerberging me?!

Jerry’s badly beaten, clothes tattered. He dusts himself off

Morty is sitting at his computer. Jerry opens the door,
startling him a bit.
MORTY 260
Dad, what happened?
JERRY 261
Eh, some people just can’t handle
the truth. Especially dummies like
me. Morty, I’m not as smart as
Rick, but I promise never to make
that your problem again.
Jerry starts to walk away.
MORTY 262
Dad?
(after he turns)
Nobody’s smarter than Rick. But
nobody else is my dad. You’re a
genius at that.
JERRY 263
(choked up)
That’s... humbling and flattering.

What’s say we finish ourselves an
eight planet solar system?
Morty holds up a Ziploc bag with the butter passing robot in
it.

I’m just going to take in this
thing Rick made and get an A.

He dumped me.
She flops on the couch beside him.
RICK 274
Oof. Sorry.
SUMMER 275
Did we learn a lesson here I’m not
seeing?
RICK 276
Not sure.
SUMMER 277
Maybe in a much bigger way, Mr.
Needful gave us both what we really
wanted? Because I was always
jealous of you hanging out with
Morty, and you didn’t realize how
much you valued my approval?
RAM 109 "NEEDFUL THINGS" NUMBERED RECORD DRAFT (5/9/13) 33.
MORTY (CONT'D)

Nah, not satisfying.
RICK 279

No. That’s dumb.
RICK (CONT’D) 280
Tell you what, though. If it’s
satisfaction you’re after, I think
I have an idea.

SUMMER 281
Uh huh. Totally. Let’s do it.
MONTAGE:
Cue “Push It To The Limit” from Scarface.
-Summer and Rick work out, lifting weights in the garage,
spotting each other.
-In a locker room, Summer injects Rick’s butt cheek with
something, then Rick does the same to her.
-Some time has passed, now they’re pumping iron at a gym.
They’re fitter, a little more muscular. They do a series of
different strength training.

W-why?

microphone, he winces in fear.

Because sometimes, what you really
need is for someone else to pay a
