ACT ONE
EXT. SPACE - ESTABLISHING
Rick’s ship flies through space.
RICK 1
Learning to fly this thing, Morty,
is gonna be really liberating.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - SPACE
RICK, MORTY, and JERRY are flying through space. Jerry is in
the backseat. Rick is in the passenger seat.
RICK 1A
You know, y-y-you’re gonna be free
to go on all kinds of errands for
me.
MORTY 2
Cool.
RICK 3
See that planet right there? Don’t
fly too close to that planet,
someone will come out and try to
wash your windshield.
We hear an old Nokia-style ringtone of “Back That Azz Up.”
RICK (CONT’D) 4
Hold on.
(answering phone, sketchy)
Yeah. Yeah, I have it. Where do you
want to meet? Alright, cool.
He hangs up, excited.
RICK (CONT’D) 5
Alright, Morty, lesson’s over.
We got some business to attend to a
few light minutes south of here.
JERRY 6
Oh, you still use “south” in space.
6A Rick SCREAMS in shock.
RICK 7
Whoa, Jesus, Jerry, what the hell
are you doing here?
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 1.
JERRY 8
What are you talking about, we
agreed a boy’s father should be
present when he’s learning to
drive.
RICK 9
I guess I remember that. Wow, and
you’ve just been back there this
whole time? Amazing.
(checks watch)
Well we don’t have time to take him
to Earth, Morty. W- head for
3924917.
JERRY 10
Cool, haha! Looks like I’m coming
along for an adventure.
RICK 11
Yyyyep.
EXT. SPACE - ELSEWHERE
Rick’s ship arrives at some empty stretch of space.
MORTY (V.O.) 12
This is where we’re going?
RICK (V.O.) 13
Nope.
An asteroid covered with the futuristic alien equivalent of a
strip mall shimmers into existence and narrowly misses them
as it soars by. Dumpy bus-looking spaceships and other craft
soar away from it.
RICK (V.O.) 14
This is. You can park in a handicap
spot, Morty. Anything with less
than eight limbs is considered
disabled here.
INT. STERILE BUILDING - DAY
Rick, Jerry, and Morty enter this strip mall lobby that feels
like a low-budget animal hospital or car rental. Rick nods at
a REPTILIAN CLERK behind the counter, who slides a clipboard
to him, which he starts filling out.
HELEN, a large, motherly reptilian, approaches Jerry.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 2.
HELEN 15
Well, look at this fella! Aren’t
you handsome.
JERRY 16
Thank you. I’m Jerry.
HELEN 17
Oh I know you are. Did you come
here in a spaceship?
She escorts him out of the room.
INT. HALL - SOON
Jerry is flattered by the attention.
JERRY 18
I’m traveling with my son and
father-in-law - w-wait, are they
coming?
HELEN 19
Oh they’ll be back soon.
JERRY 20
What?
She opens a door and ushers him through.
INT. JERRYBOREE - CONTINUOUS
20A Jerry enters a room containing DOZENS OF JERRYS. Some are
sleeping, most of them are walking around aimlessly saying
things like “excuse me” and “can I get some help here?”
JERRY 21
What the hell?
ANOTHER JERRY standing nearby turns to our Jerry.
ANOTHER JERRY 22
(sharing his outrage)
I know, right?
YET ANOTHER JERRY is ushered into the room by another
reptilian. That Jerry looks around.
YET ANOTHER JERRY 23
Oh, what the hell?
Our Jerry looks at him.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 3.
JERRY 24
I know, right?
INT. STERILE BUILDING - SAME TIME
Rick continues filling out the forms on the clipboard. Morty
is looking at displayed literature for this place, which is
apparently called:
MORTY 25
“Jerryboree?” You created a daycare
for my dad?
RICK 26
Are you kidding, I wish I had this
idea. Well, I did have this idea,
but I wish I was the version of me
that owned it. That guy’s rich.
REPTILIAN CLERK 27
Don’t forget to check the reason
for your drop off.
We see the form Rick’s filling out includes options like
“Earth under siege” and “threatened to tell Beth.”
We catch another glimpse of the form Rick’s filling out,
which contains an outline of a Jerry where you can indicate
existing physical Jerry damage. There’s two options for
length of stay: “unknown” and “forever.”
RICK 31
Trust me, Morty, I’ve heard stories
from other Ricks. Jerrys don’t tend
to last five minutes off of Earth.
Here they can romp and play with
other Jerrys and this is a totally
unregistered cross-temporal
asteroid, he couldn’t be safer.
(hands Morty a scrap)
Hey, Morty, hang on to this. That
number is your Dad. If you lose it,
we’re not gonna be able to get him
back.
EXT. SPACE PARKING GARAGE - DAY - ESTABLISHING
INT. SPACE PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Rick’s ship soars in and nearly hits several better-looking
spaceships while parking.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 4.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
RICK 32
Okay, wait here.
MORTY 33
I want to come with.
RICK 34
Don’t come with, it’s boring, it’s-
(BURP) it’s business stuff.
MORTY 35
What kind of business do you do in
a garage? You know this seems a
little shady.
RICK 36
Right, yeah, like nothing shady
ever happened in a fully furnished
office? You ever hear about Wall
Street, Morty? Y-y-y-you know what
those guys do in a- in th- in their
fancy board rooms? They take their
balls and they dip them in cocaine
and wipe them all over each other.
You know, grandpa goes around and
he does his business in public
because grandpa isn’t shady.
KROMBOPULOS MICHAEL, a tough-looking creature, appears at
Rick’s window and taps on the glass.
RICK (CONT’D) 37
Ah, crap.
(rolling down window)
Hey, what’s up?
KROMBOPULOS MICHAEL 38
Hey, Rick!
(holds up a bag)
Haha, here you go, three thousand
flerbos. Do you have the weapon?
RICK 39
(embarrassed)
C-can we please - this is my
grandson, Morty.
KROMBOPULOS MICHAEL 40
Well hi, Morty! I’m Krombopulos
Michael, I’m an assassin, I buy
guns from your grandpa!
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 5.
RICK 41
Ugh. Unbelievable.
(hands out a case)
Here. Go away.
Michael opens the case and brandishes a sinister looking ray
gun.
KROMBOPULOS MICHAEL 42
Ooooh, yeah, this looks deadly. So
this shoots anti-matter? My target
can’t be killed with regular
matter. Nice to meet you, Morty.
(offers card)
Listen, if you ever need anybody
murdered please give me a call. I’m
very discreet, I have no code of
ethics, I will kill anyone
anywhere. Children, animals, old
people, it doesn’t matter. I just
love killin’.
RICK 45
You’re g- you’re giving him a
card?!
Morty takes Michael’s card. It’s a high-tech holographic card
displaying Michael’s smiling face, his dynamically updated
coordinates and, of course, “Krombopulos Michael, Killer.”
Michael walks away, leaving Morty and Rick in silence for a
beat.
MORTY 46
You sell weapons to killers? For
money?
The camera slowly pushes into Rick’s face as if Morty, and
the audience, is about to learn the most epic truth revealed
in the show thus far.
RICK 47
Ugh, you’ve got what the
intergalactic call a very planetary
mindset, Morty. It’s more
complicated out here, this isn’t
“money,” these are flerbos. Do you
understand what two humans can
accomplish with three thousand of
these?
MORTY 48
Uh, what?
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 6.
RICK 49
An entire afternoon at BLIPS AND
CHIIIIIIITZ!
We ZOOM INTO his happy mouth, and when we zoom out we’re in:
INT. BLIPS & CHITZ - DAY
An intergalactic arcade with all the coolest games and eats.
RICK 50
Oh, this place is the best, it’s
got beer, games, prizes, and you
can never tell what time it is.
They walk past a bank of gaming machines.
MORTY 51
You sold a gun to a murderer so you
could play video games?
RICK 52
Yeah sure, I mean if you spend all
day shuffling words around you can
make anything sound bad, Morty.
Here, check this out.
Rick slaps a helmet from one of the machines onto Morty’s
head and inserts a flerbo. Morty’s eyes roll back.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
52A ROY, a twelve year old boy, wakes with a start. His MOM is
sitting on the edge of the bed.
ROY 52B *
Ah! *
MOM 53
Roy, what’s wrong?
ROY 54
I had a nightmare. I was with an
old man. He put a helmet on me...
MOM 55
It’s just a fever. Get some sleep,
I don’t want you missing school on
Monday.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 7.
INT. SCHOOL - DAY
Roy studies a textbook while we hear a TEACHER instructing.
TEACHER (V.O.) 56
I want you kids to look around you
today and think about your future.
Roy looks out the window at kids playing football.
TEACHER (V.O.) 57
Now is the time in your life when
anything is possible.
57A We zoom in on the spiraling football. The football is caught
by a twenty year old Roy as a stadium cheers. He runs.
SPORTSCASTER (V.O.) 58
Spiraling perfectly it’s gonna be
caught by Roy Parsons. Roy Parsons
is at the twenty, now he’s at the
TEN, NOTHING CAN STOP ROY THE
ROCKET! TOUCHDOWN!
Roy catches the eye of RHONDA, a bookish girl in the crowd.
They smile at each other. We dissolve on Rhonda’s face to:
INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING
Thirty year old Rhonda in a modest home addresses a thirty
year old Roy across the dinner table as their eight year old
son picks at his food.
RHONDA 59
I just think it’s time to get
realistic. Have you talked to my
father about the carpet store? Roy?
INT. CARPET STORE - DAY
59A Forty year old Roy takes inventory in a carpet store. He
sighs. It’s a living. His phone rings. He looks at it.
The caller ID reads “Doctor Schmidt.”
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
DOCTOR SCHMIDT somberly explains test results to Roy.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 8.
DOCTOR SCHMIDT 60
Had we caught it sooner... well,
hindsight is twenty twenty, Roy,
what’s important is that we move
quickly.
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
A forty eight year old, emaciated Roy is in a hospital bed.
Rhonda holds his hand.
ROY 61
I’m not ready to die.
RHONDA 62
You’re not going to.
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
62A Roy is wheeled into his house. His family cheers from around
a table with a cake, under a banner that says “CANCER CAN’T
STOP THE ROCKET.” It’s a jubilant scene.
INT. CARPET STORE - DAY
Roy is fifty five now. He pleasantly shakes hands with a
satisfied CUSTOMER.
CUSTOMER 63
Hey thanks for the carpet, Roy.
Roy watches the customer go, then turns to look at his desk.
There’s a trophy with a football on it that says “World’s
Greatest Dad.” Roy smiles to himself.
MANAGER (V.O.) 64
Hey Roy, you pull those Persian offwhite shags for the clearance sale?
64A Roy goes to a step ladder and starts struggling with a roll
of carpet. He loses his balance, falls off the ladder and
breaks his neck. His eyes roll back into his head.
ROY 64AA
Whoa, sh- shiiit! Agh.
The words “GAME OVER” appear over his death in spooky font.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 9.
INT. BLIPS & CHITZ - LATER
64B Morty’s eyes roll back down and he rips the helmet off his
head in shock, looking around.
MORTY 65
Hoh, what the hell?! W-w-where am
I? What in the hell?!
65A Rick has been drinking his beer and watching the screen on
Morty’s machine, which we now see is a game called “Roy: A
Life Well Lived.”
RICK 66
(examining screen)
Fifty five years. Not bad, Morty. Yyou kind of wasted your thirties
though with that whole “bird
watching” phase.
MORTY 67
W-where- where’s my wife? *
RICK 68
Morty, you were just playing a
game. It’s called Roy. Snap out of
it. Come on.
Rick grabs tickets from the machine, hands them to Morty and
takes the helmet.
MORTY 69
(remembering)
I’m Morty. You’re Rick.
(back to himself)
Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that
kills people!
RICK 70
Look at this...
(re: screen)
You beat cancer, and then you went
back to work at the carpet store?
Boo.
MORTY 71
D-don’t dodge the issue, Rick!
Selling a gun to a hitman is the
same as pulling the trigger!
RICK 72
It’s also the same as doing
nothing.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 10.
(MORE)
If Krombopulos Michael wants
someone dead, there’s not a lot
anyone can do to stop him, that’s
why he does it for a living.
(putting on helmet)
Now excuse me, it’s time to thrash
your Roy score.
MORTY 73
You know, you could stop this
killing from happening, Rick. You
know, y-you did a bad thing selling
that gun but you could undo it if
you wanted.
RICK 74
(half concentrating)
Uh huh. Yeah that’s the difference *
between you and me, Morty. I never
go back to the carpet store.
Rick fully concentrates on the game. A passing RANDOM ALIEN
notices Rick’s skills.
RANDOM ALIEN 75
Holy shit, this guy’s taking Roy
off the grid!
(calling out)
This guy doesn’t have a social *
security number for Roy!
75A A small crowd gathers around the machine. Morty fumes for a
beat, then storms off.
INT. JERRYBOREE - DAY
Jerry, upset, talks to Helen at the front desk.
JERRY 76
Hi, I’m sorry, I think there was a
misunderstanding. I’m an adult and
would like to go home, please.
HELEN 77
Well of course, right through that
tube.
77A Jerry looks around annoyed, but still enters the tube.
JERRY 78
Unbelievable.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 11.
RICK (CONT'D)
HELEN 79
You’re doing great!
JERRY 80
(indignant)
I know how to crawl in a tube.
(crawling)
Ah, come on. Uch, this is harder
than it looks.
80A (Jerry does not know how to crawl through a tube). As he goes
through, we now see a huge room with tons of these tubes.
Jerry keeps crawling and reaches a slide.
JERRY (CONT’D) 81
Whooooa!
81A He curls around and then flies out into:
INT. JERRYBOREE - BALL PIT - CONTINUOUS
81B Other Jerrys are having fun in the ball pit. The ENTIRE ROOM
is decorated like a play version of Morty’s home.
JERRY 82
You guys are enjoying this? Don’t
you feel a little patronized?
OTHER JERRY 83
How so?
Just then an alien dressed in a large, PLUSHY BETH costume
comes in.
PLUSHY BETH 84
Jeerrrrry!
JERRY 85
Oh come on, this is ridiculous.
PLUSHY BETH 86
I love you, Jerry!
JERRY 87
(melting)
Awww, Beeeth!
PLUSHY BETH 88
Who wants to come watch Midnight
Run with director’s commentary on?
OTHER JERRYS 89
Yeah! / Definitely! / Yes!
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 12.
PLUSHY BETH 92
First one there gets to adjust the
picture settings!
JERRY 93
(immediately turned)
The factory tint setting is always
too high! Out of my way!
93A Jerry, now excited, chases Plushy Beth with all the others.
ANOTHER JERRY 93AA *
- tint setting is always too high! *
INT. JERRYBOREE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Jerry watches Midnight Run with Plushy Beth and tons of other
Jerrys there, too. He rests his head on her shoulder.
EXT. GROMFLAM MILITARY BASE - DAY
93B Krombopulos Michael, geared up like a Navy Seal, goes through
a spiritual ritual. He takes a locket, wraps it in a
handkerchief, and kisses it.
KROMBOPULOS MICHAEL 93AA
Oh boy, here I go killing again.
As cool HEIST MUSIC plays...
EXT. / INT. GROMFLAM MILITARY BASE - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY
93C - Krombopulos, with highly trained precision, crawls through
a vent, drops on a guard, and puts him in a sleeper hold.
93D - Krombopulos hugs a wall, eyes two security cameras, skips
by without them seeing, and sleeper holds a guard with his
feet.
93E/F - Krombopulos monkey bars on pipes down in the sewer, cuts a
hole out of a ceiling above him, a guy falls through. He
catches him, sleeper holds him, then places him down gently.
93G - Through one final sequence, he takes an unconscious guard’s
finger, places it on a scanner, the guard wakes up and he
sleeper holds him again, then opens a secure door to:
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 13.
INT. GROMFLAM MILITARY BASE - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
KOOF (a glowing gaseous cloud of light) hovers in the center
of a small holding cell, the “bars” of which are rays of some
kind. Krombopulos enters and produces the sinister weapon
Rick made. He levels it on the gaseous cloud.
93H Rick’s ship smashes through the wall and into the room
exactly where Michael was standing, obliterating Michael and
burying itself halfway into the floor.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Krombopulos Michael’s business card is on the dashboard. Amid *
the sounds of leaking steam and falling debris is the sound
of the ship’s navigation system:
NAVIGATION (V.O.) 94
You, have, arrived at...
(splice)
Krombopulos Michael. Your
destination is below.
94A Morty is slumped over the steering wheel of the craft,
knocked out from the impact. He slowly regains consciousness.
MORTY 95
(dazed)
We’re all out of off-white Persian.
INT. GROMFLAM MILITARY BASE - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
Morty exits the vehicle, looking around. Among the debris, he
finds Michael’s arm, still holding the gun.
MORTY 96
Aw, man. W-w-w-what have I done?
GUARD 97
Drop the gun!
A guard with a laser rifle has the drop on Morty. Morty
doesn’t know what to do.
MORTY 98
Y-you don’t understand.
(points to Krombopulos)
This guy was gonna kill someone.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 14.
GUARD 99
(raises his gun)
I guess that makes two of us.
Hurgh!
99A A Rick portal appears in the middle of the guard’s body,
splitting him down the center like a knife splitting a piece
of fruit. The front of his body falls forward, the back falls
backward, leaving two even slices of guard on the floor as
Rick steps through the portal onto the front half.
RICK 100
What are you doing, Morty? This is
a Galactic Federation outpost! *
Look, I don’t have time to tell you
my entire backstory but you need to
understand that Grandpa and
government don’t get along.
KOOF 101
He saved my life.
101A Rick and Morty are startled that the imprisoned cloud is
speaking.
RICK 101B
What?
MORTY 102
Huh? Whoa! Are you Krombopulos
Michael’s target? W-w-w-what’s your
name?
KOOF 103
My kind has no use for names. I
communicate through what you call
Jessica’s feet. No. Telepathy.
RICK 104
Oh, good job, Morty. Y-y-you- you
killed my best customer but you
saved a mind-reading fart.
KOOF 105
I like this name, “Fart.” Morty,
would you kindly release me by
pulling that lever to the left of
my cell? I am in great pain.
105A Morty pulls the lever next to the cell, deactivating its
laser bars. An ALARM sounds.
MORTY 106
Oh crap. Let’s get you out of here.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 15.
RICK 107
We can’t get him out of here. He’s
gaseous, he’s not gonna make it
through a portal, Morty.
MORTY 108
Well then I guess we’re all getting
in the car. Right, uh...
KOOF 109
Fart.
MORTY 110
No! Just- j-j-just get in the car.
Morty opens the door to Rick’s ship. Koof floats in.
RICK 111
Morty, come on. W- I wanna go back
to Blips and Chitz. I don’t wanna
deal with this.
MORTY 112
Rick, you’ve been clear on the fact
that you don’t wanna help, so just
go away.
KOOF 113
More are coming.
Rick hears more guards coming.
RICK 114
Screw this. I’m out.
114A Rick goes back through a portal, which disappears. Morty is
stunned for a moment, then shakes it off and tries to start
the ship. He can’t.
MORTY 114B
Ohhh. Come on, come on!
Several guards show up.
GUARD 115
Get out of the vehicle made of
garbage or we will open fire!
MORTY 116
Um um um um.
Morty keeps trying to start the ship.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 16.
GUARD 119
Open fire!
A portal opens in the ceiling above them and a solid, six
foot diameter torrent of sea water quickly fills up the room.
119A Morty watches as the guards float around outside the space
ship, panicking.
119B Another portal opens in the floor beneath them and the room
quickly drains of water, taking all the guards with it as if
they’re being sucked down a drain.
That portal closes before a third opens and Rick walks
through.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
119C Rick climbs in, shoving Morty over.
RICK 120
Stupid ass fart saving carpet store
motherfucker. Move.
Rick tries the ship’s controls.
RICK (CONT’D) 121
Wait, did you fuck with my seat
settings?
A long beat as Rick moves the seat forward and back as more
guards close in.
KOOF 121A
More are coming.
MORTY 122
Rick!
RICK 123
Yeah, yeah.
With difficulty, the ship crushes the guards and exits
through the hole whence it came or whatever Shakespeare would
say.
END OF ACT ONE

ACT TWO
EXT. GEARTOWN - DAY
We land on a particular business: Cogspot. *
INT. COGSPOT - GARAGE - DAY *
Morty, Rick, and Koof are in a cluttered mechanic’s garage.
GEARHEAD is working on Rick’s battered ship.
GEARHEAD 127
Your geldon converter is pretty
dinged up.
RICK 128
That’s because my grandson drives
like a male Obravadian. Yeah I said
it. Some stereotypes are based in
fact.
GEARHEAD 129
Actually it’s because of years of
neglect. You really need to respect
your gears, Rick. To you they’re
just wheels with teeth, but in my
culture, wars have been fought.
Entire--
RICK 130
So I’ve heard. Just fix it.
Rick walks over to Morty and Koof.
RICK (CONT’D) 131
I don’t think the Gromflamites can
track us now but it looks like
we’re gonna be here for a while.
(takes Morty aside)
Or, you know, if you still have the
gun K. Michael dropped we could
finish the job and go home.
KOOF 132
You do understand I’m telepathic,
right?
RICK 133
I’m being polite.
RAM 202 "MORTY-NIGHT RUN" FINAL ANIMATIC DRAFT (9/8/14) 18.
MORTY 134
Rick, we’re taking him back where
he belongs.
RICK 135
Oh yeah, where’s that? (BURP) Are
you going on a quest to find He Who
Smelt It?
KOOF 136
I came here accidentally through a
wormhole located in what you call
get out of my head, Fart, I know
you’re in here. Lalalala. No. In
what you call the Promethean
Nebula.
RICK 137
Oh great, just a hop skip and an
eight hundred light year jump.
MORTY 138
You know you can leave any time you
want, Rick.
138A Rick mutters and walks off.
RICK 138B
Whatever you wanna do you little
punk ass little bitch. I’m gonna go
to Blips and Chitz.
KOOF 139
Thank you, Morty. You are not like
other carbon-based life forms. You
put the value of all life above

It’s how things should be. I-it’s
how they could be.
KOOF 141
I could not agree more.

The worlds can be one together...
Morty gets a strange, entranced look on his face. As a David
Bowie-style tune begins. We enter:

Koof flies Morty through space in their shared imagination.

KOOF 142
Cosmos without hatred.
Stars like diamonds in your eyes.
Morty flies through a cosmic void. Surreal images blur and
transform into each other.
KOOF (CONT’D) 143
The ground can be space (space
space space space),
With feet marching towards a
peaceful sky.
All the moon men want things their
way,
But we make sure they see the sun.
Goodbye, moon men. You say:
Moon men wave goodbye.
KOOF (CONT’D) 144
Goodbye, moon men.
Morty and Koof float away from the moon men.

Morty looks embarrassed.

147A Jerry sits at a computer, GIGGLING. On screen: we see an
email subject: “FWD: FWD: FUNNY! MUSLIM & A DUCK GO GOLFING!”
He clicks “FORWARD.”
A Jerry next to him LAUGHS.
ANOTHER JERRY 148
Duck duck birdie! Very funny.

some clicks, then GIGGLES. Jerry takes a sip of iced tea.

Here comes another funny.
He sends another email.
OTHER JERRY 149A

Oh this place is great.
JERRY 149B
I almost wish I could stay longer

You just might.
JERRY 151
W-what do you mean?
INT. JERRYBOREE - LOST WING - LATER
Other Jerry leads Jerry into a wing of wounded, abandoned,
jaded Jerrys. One has a buzz cut, one wears a tank top, etc.
OTHER JERRY 152
These are the Jerrys whose Ricks

live here now.
152A/B Our Jerry gets nervous. He shudders.

Rick is watching Ball Fondlers on TV.
A breaking news report comes in.

No gear-turnings as of yet in the
curious case of these unidentified

Rick storms up to Morty and Koof.
RICK (CONT’D) 155
Why were the Gromflamites holding *
you prisoner? What the fuck is so *
valuable about you?
KOOF 156
I am no more valuable than life
itself. However I am able to alter
the composition of atoms, like
this:
Koof’s cloud pulses with electrical arcs and cycles through
various colors before dropping a lump of gold on the floor.
KOOF (CONT’D) 157
That was oxygen. I added seventy
one protons to it.
RICK 158
Oh terrific. No wonder every cop in
the system is looking for us. Any
species that gets a hold of this
thing is gonna use it to take over
the galaxy. You know how
inconvenient that’s gonna be to my
work?
A sound prompts Rick to go to a window.
Government ships are hovering outside the garage.
RICK (CONT’D) 159
Somebody dropped the dime on us.
(realizing)
Gearhead.
Rick turns to Gearhead, who is holding a gear gun on them.
GEARHEAD 160
I’m sorry, Rick. The reward on your
head is too high. And like you
always say, you gotta look out for
number one.
RICK 161
Number one is ME, asshole! You’re
supposed to be my friend!
GEARHEAD 162
Friend? Do you even know my real
name? It’s Revolio Clockberg
Junior.

I belong to an entire species of
Gear People. Calling me Gearhead is
like calling a Chinese person Asia
Face.
164A Rick spies an open box full of twigs. He grabs a handful and
throws them at Gearhead.
GEARHEAD (CONT’D) 165
No! Not twigs!
165A/B The twigs get stuck in the gears on Gearhead’s head, causing
them to jam. Horrible sounds come from his interior. He drops
his gun and tries to get the twigs out.
165B Rick runs up to Gearhead, grabs one of his arms and twists it
in a deliberate fashion.
165C/D The small double hatch on Gearhead’s crotch slides open. Rick
reaches in through the hatch and pulls out two small gears.
Gearhead lets out a high pitched shriek. Rick grabs two of
the gears on Gearhead’s mouth, pulls them off as well, then
replaces them with the gears from Gearhead’s crotch. Gearhead
makes horrible sounds and falls to his knees in shock.
RICK 166
Two things I want to make clear to
everybody in this room: Never *
betray me and it’s time to go.
Rick, Morty, and Koof jump in Rick’s ship. It takes off
through a nearby window. *
Two GEAR COPS run in with weapons.
GEAR COP 167
Nobody move!
167A Gearhead has gotten to his feet and stumbles over to the
cops, making horrible muffled sounds, pointing at his face.
GEAR COP (CONT’D) 168
Oh my GOD! Are those--
168A Both gear cops start gagging. Maybe they puke but I don’t
know what gear people vomit.
EXT. GEARTOWN - GEAR ALLEY - DAY
Rick’s ship flies through a densely populated alley: vendors
peddle gear wares, an old gear woman wearing a babushka flaps
the dust of a dirty gear out a window, children do playful
gear-related things.

GEARHEAD (CONT'D)
Two government motorcycle ships give pursuit and open fire on
them.
170A Rick shoots one of the aliens off its motorcycle. The other
crashes into a parked gear car.
RICK 171
Hey, Morty, remember when you said
selling a gun was as bad as pulling
the trigger? How do you feel about
all these people that are getting
killed today because of your
choices?
MORTY 172
I did the right thing, Rick!
RICK 173
Tell that to Gearhead’s
gearsticles!
MORTY 174
You did that!
RICK 175
Wrong, I’d be playing Roy right
now, at a certain point my hands
are tied, Morty!
Rick and Morty take a hard right, where two more ships start *
chasing and shooting at them.

JERRY 183
But if you can leave, then why are
you still here?

Same reason as you. We’re Jerrys. *

Jerry marches past Helen.
JERRY 185
I’m leaving!
HELEN 186
Okay then! That was always allowed!
INT. RICK’S SHIP - LATER
Rick and Morty have three ships on their tail now.
Rick puts on the brakes and the ships fly by. Rick shoots
them and the ships crash.
Now, WAY MORE people and bigger ships start pursuing them.
RICK 187
Morty, take the wheel!
Morty takes the wheel as Rick shoots at people.
MORTY 188
Whoa!!
188A Morty jerks the wheel and Rick falls over.
RICK 189
Whoa! Jeez dammit, Morty, who
taught you to fly this thing?
Hahaha I’m kidding I know that’s on *
me.

An alien cop is seated behind the flight stick of his squad

him.

I wonder why Greg is always so
critical of my girlfriend?
ALIEN COP (V.O.) 194

Well, he’d probably like to have me

KOOF 195
Or does he want her to himself.
